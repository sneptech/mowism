**??? Help Detection:**
If `$ARGUMENTS` contains "???" (e.g., the user typed `/mow:resume-work ???`):
1. Extract the command name: `resume-work`
2. Run `/mow:help-open resume-work` to open the help file in the user's editor
3. Stop here -- do NOT proceed with the normal command execution below

<objective>
Restore complete project context and resume work seamlessly from previous session.

Routes to the resume-project workflow which handles:

- STATE.md loading (or reconstruction if missing)
- Checkpoint detection (.continue-here files)
- Incomplete work detection (PLAN without SUMMARY)
- Status presentation
- Context-aware next action routing
  </objective>

<execution_context>
@~/.claude/mowism/workflows/resume-project.md
</execution_context>

<process>
**Follow the resume-project workflow** from `@~/.claude/mowism/workflows/resume-project.md`.

The workflow handles all resumption logic including:

1. Project existence verification
2. STATE.md loading or reconstruction
3. Checkpoint and incomplete work detection
4. Visual status presentation
5. Context-aware option offering (checks CONTEXT.md before suggesting plan vs discuss)
6. Routing to appropriate next command
7. Session continuity updates
   </process>
