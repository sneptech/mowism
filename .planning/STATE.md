# Project State

## Project Reference

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 3-phase quick-depth structure -- fork first, then new features, then coordination/distribution
- [Roadmap]: Quality skills (SKIL-*) grouped with fork phase since they are existing assets being ported, not new features

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Agent Teams API is experimental and may change before Phase 3 implementation (monitor Anthropic releases)
- Worktree state merge conflicts for `.planning/STATE.md` concurrent updates not fully solved (address in Phase 2)
