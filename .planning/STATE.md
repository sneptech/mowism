# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-19)

**Core value:** Multiple Claude Code agents can work in parallel across git worktrees with coherent shared state, automated quality gates, and coordinated orchestration -- without manual context-checking between sessions.
**Current focus:** Phase 5: Fix Update Workflow

## Current Position

Phase: 5 of 5 (Fix Update Workflow)
Plan: 1 of 1 in current phase
Status: Complete
Last activity: 2026-02-20 -- Completed 05-01 (Fix update workflow)

Progress: [██████████] 100% (1/1 plans in Phase 5)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 3-phase quick-depth structure -- fork first, then new features, then coordination/distribution
- [Roadmap]: Quality skills (SKIL-*) grouped with fork phase since they are existing assets being ported, not new features
- [01-01]: Files tracked in both ~/.claude/mowism/bin/ (install) and bin/ (git repo source)
- [01-01]: Single GSD origin comment preserved in header per plan guidance
- [01-02]: Preserved original gsd-*.md agent files (coexistence per locked decision)
- [01-02]: Applied ordered replacement table (most-specific-first) to prevent double-replacement artifacts
- [01-02]: Files live in ~/.claude/ outside git repo -- tracked via planning artifacts only
- [01-03]: Quality skill commands stored in commands/ (repo) AND ~/.claude/commands/ (global install)
- [01-03]: Skills are fully standalone with no dependencies on mow-tools or mow workflows
- [01-04]: Replaced npm-based update mechanism with git-pull placeholder (full install/update in Phase 3)
- [01-04]: Applied ordered replacement table with additional brand context patterns for workflow files
- [01-04]: Files live in ~/.claude/ outside git repo -- tracked via planning artifacts only
- [01-05]: Dropped join-discord.md per research recommendation (don't link to GSD Discord under Mowism brand)
- [01-05]: Added missing name: frontmatter to reapply-patches.md and rebranded gsd-local-patches to mow-local-patches
- [01-05]: Files live in ~/.claude/ outside git repo -- tracked via planning artifacts only
- [01-06]: Origin comment in mow-tools.cjs line 6 left as acceptable GSD acknowledgment
- [01-06]: GSD references in migrate.md are instructional content (what-to-replace), not functional -- left as-is
- [01-06]: Phase 1 validation sweep passed: zero functional GSD strings, zero broken references, 83/83 tests pass
- [02-01]: WorkTrunk dependency check added to all mow-tools.cjs init functions
- [02-02]: Auto-tier defaults to 'complex' when uncertain (per research recommendation)
- [02-02]: Stage 2 placeholder comment for Plan 02-04 to inject parallel quality checks
- [02-02]: Each Task() subagent writes findings with YAML frontmatter for machine-readable results
- [Phase 02-01]: checkWorkTrunk uses POSIX command (not which/type) for portability
- [Phase 02-01]: Worktree conflict detection is a hard block (error+exit), not a warning
- [Phase 02-01]: Stale worktree cleanup runs silently on every init, never blocks on failure
- [02-04]: Change-summary serves as natural reconciliation point for conflicting findings (no separate step)
- [02-04]: VERIFICATION-CHAIN index generated by orchestrator reading only frontmatter from findings files
- [02-04]: Algorithmic tier includes all complex tier checks plus prove-it (4 total parallel)
- [02-03]: Auto-configure wt.toml on execute-phase init (non-destructive, no user approval needed)
- [02-03]: Worktree claim happens after phase validation, not before
- [02-03]: Failed executions preserve the claim for resume (not auto-released)
- [02-03]: Refine-phase suggestion only shown when verification passed (not if gaps_found)
- [02-05]: All 14 Phase 2 requirements validated without code fixes -- deliverables correct as built
- [03-02]: WorkTrunk version captured via stderr redirect (wt --version writes to stderr)
- [03-02]: Help file copy guarded with directory existence check since Plan 03-03 creates help files later
- [03-04]: Lead orchestrator is a router (active task management), not a passive monitor
- [03-04]: Lead uses only Agent Teams API primitives -- no custom coordination layer
- [Phase 03]: Agent Teams detection checks process.env first, falls back to ~/.claude/settings.json
- [Phase 03]: Team status section inserted before Session Continuity in STATE.md
- [Phase 03]: Nudge dismiss merges into existing config.json rather than overwriting
- [03-05]: New projects always show prominent nudge regardless of dismiss state
- [03-05]: Resume-project shows lighter tooltip (not full nudge) since new-project already nudged
- [03-05]: Execute-phase shows prominent nudge when not dismissed, lighter tooltip when dismissed
- [Phase 03]: [03-03]: Editor fallback chain: $VISUAL -> $EDITOR -> nano -> vi -> less -> cat
- [Phase 03]: [03-03]: Help files use 5-section format: Usage, Arguments/Flags, What Happens, Examples, Related
- [Phase 03]: [03-03]: ??? detection block placed after frontmatter ---, before command body
- [03-06]: All 10 Phase 3 requirements validated PASS without code fixes -- deliverables correct as built
- [04-02]: Case-insensitive matching via .toLowerCase() for env var and settings.json Agent Teams detection
- [Phase 04-01]: Phase 4 plan files excluded from replacement to preserve documentation context
- [Phase 04-01]: No tilde-in-double-quotes issues found -- all bash contexts use unquoted paths
- [04-03]: All 5 Phase 4 requirements validated PASS -- end-to-end portability confirmed with 103/103 tests passing
- [05-01]: Update source configurable via .update-source file rather than hardcoded URL
- [05-01]: INSTALL_SH path uses temp dir clone + re-run install.sh (reuses existing verified installer)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Agent Teams API is experimental and may change before Phase 3 implementation (monitor Anthropic releases)
- Worktree state merge conflicts for `.planning/STATE.md` concurrent updates not fully solved (address in Phase 2)
