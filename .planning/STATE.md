# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-19)

**Core value:** Multiple Claude Code agents can work in parallel across git worktrees with coherent shared state, automated quality gates, and coordinated orchestration -- without manual context-checking between sessions.
**Current focus:** Phase 3: Agent Teams and Distribution

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 3 (Agent Teams and Distribution)
Plan: 2 of 6 in current phase
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-02-19 -- Completed 03-02 (Repo distribution: install.sh + README)

Progress: [███-------] 33% (2/6 plans in Phase 3)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 13
- Average duration: 3min
- Total execution time: 0.65 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-fork-and-foundation | 6 | 23min | 4min |
| 02-worktree-state-and-quality-gates | 5 | 16min | 3min |
| 03-agent-teams-and-distribution | 2 | 3min | 3min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 02-03 (5min), 02-05 (3min), 03-01 (--), 03-02 (3min)
- Trend: Steady

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 03 P01 | 4min | 2 tasks | 2 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 3-phase quick-depth structure -- fork first, then new features, then coordination/distribution
- [Roadmap]: Quality skills (SKIL-*) grouped with fork phase since they are existing assets being ported, not new features
- [01-01]: Files tracked in both ~/.claude/mowism/bin/ (install) and bin/ (git repo source)
- [01-01]: Single GSD origin comment preserved in header per plan guidance
- [01-02]: Preserved original gsd-*.md agent files (coexistence per locked decision)
- [01-02]: Applied ordered replacement table (most-specific-first) to prevent double-replacement artifacts
- [01-02]: Files live in ~/.claude/ outside git repo -- tracked via planning artifacts only
- [01-03]: Quality skill commands stored in commands/ (repo) AND ~/.claude/commands/ (global install)
- [01-03]: Skills are fully standalone with no dependencies on mow-tools or mow workflows
- [01-04]: Replaced npm-based update mechanism with git-pull placeholder (full install/update in Phase 3)
- [01-04]: Applied ordered replacement table with additional brand context patterns for workflow files
- [01-04]: Files live in ~/.claude/ outside git repo -- tracked via planning artifacts only
- [01-05]: Dropped join-discord.md per research recommendation (don't link to GSD Discord under Mowism brand)
- [01-05]: Added missing name: frontmatter to reapply-patches.md and rebranded gsd-local-patches to mow-local-patches
- [01-05]: Files live in ~/.claude/ outside git repo -- tracked via planning artifacts only
- [01-06]: Origin comment in mow-tools.cjs line 6 left as acceptable GSD acknowledgment
- [01-06]: GSD references in migrate.md are instructional content (what-to-replace), not functional -- left as-is
- [01-06]: Phase 1 validation sweep passed: zero functional GSD strings, zero broken references, 83/83 tests pass
- [02-01]: WorkTrunk dependency check added to all mow-tools.cjs init functions
- [02-02]: Auto-tier defaults to 'complex' when uncertain (per research recommendation)
- [02-02]: Stage 2 placeholder comment for Plan 02-04 to inject parallel quality checks
- [02-02]: Each Task() subagent writes findings with YAML frontmatter for machine-readable results
- [Phase 02-01]: checkWorkTrunk uses POSIX command (not which/type) for portability
- [Phase 02-01]: Worktree conflict detection is a hard block (error+exit), not a warning
- [Phase 02-01]: Stale worktree cleanup runs silently on every init, never blocks on failure
- [02-04]: Change-summary serves as natural reconciliation point for conflicting findings (no separate step)
- [02-04]: VERIFICATION-CHAIN index generated by orchestrator reading only frontmatter from findings files
- [02-04]: Algorithmic tier includes all complex tier checks plus prove-it (4 total parallel)
- [02-03]: Auto-configure wt.toml on execute-phase init (non-destructive, no user approval needed)
- [02-03]: Worktree claim happens after phase validation, not before
- [02-03]: Failed executions preserve the claim for resume (not auto-released)
- [02-03]: Refine-phase suggestion only shown when verification passed (not if gaps_found)
- [02-05]: All 14 Phase 2 requirements validated without code fixes -- deliverables correct as built
- [03-02]: WorkTrunk version captured via stderr redirect (wt --version writes to stderr)
- [03-02]: Help file copy guarded with directory existence check since Plan 03-03 creates help files later
- [Phase 03]: Agent Teams detection checks process.env first, falls back to ~/.claude/settings.json
- [Phase 03]: Team status section inserted before Session Continuity in STATE.md
- [Phase 03]: Nudge dismiss merges into existing config.json rather than overwriting

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Agent Teams API is experimental and may change before Phase 3 implementation (monitor Anthropic releases)
- Worktree state merge conflicts for `.planning/STATE.md` concurrent updates not fully solved (address in Phase 2)
