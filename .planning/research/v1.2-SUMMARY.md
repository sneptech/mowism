# Research Summary: Mowism v1.2

**Project:** Mowism v1.2 — Native Worktrees, Full-Lifecycle Workers, Auto-Advance, GSD Cherry-Pick
**Domain:** Multi-agent CLI orchestration (simplification + capability milestone)
**Researched:** 2026-02-24
**Confidence:** HIGH
**Phase numbering:** Continues from 12 (v1.1 ended at phase 12)

## Executive Summary

Mowism v1.2 is a simplification and capability milestone. The core architectural move is replacing Mowism's custom worktree creation code (cmdWorktreeCreate, WorkTrunk dependency, manifest.json) with Claude Code's native WorktreeCreate/WorktreeRemove hook system (v2.1.50), while preserving the coordination layer that Claude Code does not provide: phase-to-worktree tracking, claim/conflict prevention, merge orchestration, and shared state management. This is net code deletion of roughly 200 lines from mow-tools.cjs with new hook scripts (~85 LOC bash) replacing them. The guiding principle: adopt the platform for leaf operations, keep custom code for coordination.

The three capability additions build on this foundation. Full-lifecycle workers extend mow-phase-worker.md so phase workers autonomously chain discuss -> research -> plan -> execute -> refine via sequential Task() calls, with a mandatory user-input pause at discuss-phase. Auto-advance (`/mow:auto`) is almost entirely pre-built in the existing `--auto` flag mechanism distributed across four workflows; it needs only a single new command file (`commands/mow/auto.md`) as an entry point plus cleanup of config persistence bugs. The nine GSD upstream bugfixes are surgical edits to specific mow-tools.cjs functions and workflow files, should be ported first as correctness foundations, and must be translated as logic patterns (not cherry-picked as code) given significant fork divergence.

The critical risks are: context accumulation in full-lifecycle workers (mitigated by disk-first return values — subagents write artifacts to disk and return only compact summaries), the discuss-phase bypass hazard in auto mode (mitigated by never running discuss inline in a Task() subagent and clearing auto_advance at multi-agent session startup), and simplification overshoot (mitigated by building a capabilities matrix before removing any code and only removing the git worktree creation step). Claude Code's native features are excellent isolation primitives but provide no coordination semantics — that boundary must not blur during implementation.

## Key Findings

### Recommended Stack

v1.2 introduces zero new dependencies. The zero-npm-dependency constraint from v1.0 holds. The stack changes are all substitutions within the existing infrastructure:

**Core technologies (changes only):**
- `WorktreeCreate` / `WorktreeRemove` hooks (Claude Code v2.1.50): Replace `cmdWorktreeCreate` git worktree creation — hook controls the path, Mowism controls the coordination wrapper. Hooks are bash scripts registered in `.claude/settings.json`.
- `PostToolUse` hook (Claude Code v2.1.33+): Context window monitor via transcript byte-count estimation. Async, non-blocking, warns at 35%/25% thresholds. Critical for long-running full-lifecycle workers.
- `SubagentStart` hook (Claude Code v2.1.33+): Injects CLAUDE.md content into spawned subagents at creation time. Fixes Bug #8 (subagents lack project context) without modifying every Task() spawn site.
- Node.js callback replacers (stdlib): Fix for Bug #1 (dollar sign corruption) — replace `content.replace(regex, \`$1${value}\`)` with callback form at 5 sites. No new dependency.
- `jq` (soft dependency): Required by new hook scripts for JSON parsing stdin. Not a hard dependency; scripts fall back to `node -e` if jq is unavailable.

**What stays unchanged:** Zero-dependency CJS binary, NDJSON events, Agent Teams (experimental, unchanged), DAG scheduling, ANSI dashboard, git-based persistence, Markdown workflow files.

**Version requirements:** Claude Code 2.1.50 (WorktreeCreate/WorktreeRemove), Node.js 22.x minimum (no change from v1.1). Current environment: Claude Code 2.1.50, Node.js 25.4.0 — both satisfied.

See `.planning/research/v1.2-STACK.md` for full specifications, hook JSON schemas, and implementation patterns.

### Expected Features

**Must have (table stakes for v1.2):**
- **WorktreeCreate/WorktreeRemove hooks** — official Claude Code extension point for worktree lifecycle; hooks copy `.planning/`, init STATUS.md, update claim manifest. Without this, native worktree creation leaves workers without project context.
- **9 GSD bugfixes** — all are correctness issues hit in normal operation. Dollar sign corruption (#1) and progress bar crash (#4) are data corruption/crash severity. Feature branch timing (#3), executor infinite loop (#5), health repair data loss (#7) are P1. Guards (#6), CLAUDE.md injection (#8), todo lifecycle (#9), and requirement IDs (#2) are P2 correctness.
- **Context window monitor hook** — critical specifically for v1.2 because full-lifecycle workers have long sessions. Warns at 35%/25% remaining via async PostToolUse hook.
- **Worker chains discuss -> research -> plan -> execute -> refine** — sequential Task() calls from phase worker (teammate). Each subagent writes artifacts to disk, returns compact summary. Worker orchestrates; subagents execute.
- **Mandatory discuss-phase pause** — HARD CONSTRAINT. Discuss always pauses for user input via `input_needed` message. Never bypassed in auto mode. This is the core user-value proposition of the discuss stage.
- **Resume-awareness per lifecycle stage** — workers detect which stages are complete (CONTEXT.md exists? PLANs exist? SUMMARYs exist?) and skip completed stages on resume.
- **`/mow:auto` entry point** — single new command file that reads project state and invokes the appropriate workflow with `--auto` flag. The pipeline machinery already exists.

**Should have (competitive differentiators):**
- **DAG-aware cross-phase auto-advance** — when a phase worker completes, check DAG for newly-unblocked downstream phases and auto-start them. No competitor combines auto-advance with dependency-aware scheduling.
- **Coordination layer preserved over native primitives** — Mowism uniquely layers claiming, DAG-aware merge, and manifest tracking OVER native worktree creation. The coordination layer is what distinguishes Mowism from Cursor 2.0's flat parallelism.
- **Cost-aware model routing per lifecycle stage** — research subagent uses Haiku (read-only, cheap), executor uses executor_model profile, verifier uses verifier_model. Optimizes the 4-5 subagent spawns per worker.
- **Stage transition messaging** — workers send `stage_transition` as they move between lifecycle stages; dashboard shows discuss/plan/execute/verify granularity per phase.
- **Discuss-phase gray area looping** (GSD v1.20.6) — ambiguous preferences trigger follow-up probing. Improves discuss quality for the mandatory pause.

**Defer to v1.3:**
- Requirements tracking chain (v1.20.2-3) — full propagation roadmap->researcher->planner->checker->executor->verifier. Significant scope, hard to implement cleanly.
- mow-tools.cjs domain split (PR #691) — 8,200 lines to 11 modules. Maintenance win, not functional. Breaks single-file deployment model for no current benefit.
- Nyquist validation layer (PR #687) — requires plan tasks to have verify commands. Nice-to-have quality gate.
- `isolation: worktree` for executor subagents — creates nested worktrees (worktree-in-worktree), doubles disk, breaks merge model. Explicitly deferred.
- Partial auto-advance phase range (`/mow:auto 3 7`) — power user feature.
- Auto-advance across milestones — milestones are deliberate boundaries; cross-milestone auto is always wrong.

See `.planning/research/v1.2-FEATURES.md` for full feature landscape, competitor analysis, and prioritization matrix.

### Architecture Approach

v1.2 modifies existing components rather than creating new ones — the only new file is `commands/mow/auto.md`. The architectural pattern is hook-bridged native adoption: Claude Code handles the git worktree primitive via WorktreeCreate hook, while mow-tools.cjs retains all coordination semantics. Workers run lifecycle stages inline (reading workflow files via @file references) and use Task() only for leaf-level subagents (mow-executor, mow-verifier, mow-phase-researcher). This enforces the 3-level hierarchy (lead -> worker/teammate -> subagent) with no deeper nesting.

**Major components and their v1.2 changes:**

1. **mow-tools.cjs** — Remove ~200 LOC (cmdWorktreeCreate, cmdWorktreeStash, readManifest/writeManifest, getDefaultBranch, WT_CONFIG_CONTENT, requireWorkTrunk, ensureWtConfig). Fix 9 bugs (~50 LOC changed). Add `init auto` compound command (~40 LOC). Net reduction to ~8,000 lines.
2. **mow-phase-worker.md** — Rewrite Steps 2-3 to use Task() subagent spawning. Add Step 5 (verification subagent). The worker orchestrates the full lifecycle; subagents execute each stage. (~60% of file changes.)
3. **mow-team-lead.md** — Replace `worktree create {phase}` calls with native WorktreeCreate hook-triggered creation. Update merge flow for native worktree path discovery via `git worktree list`. (~30% of file changes.)
4. **Hook scripts (new)** — `.claude/hooks/mow-worktree-create.sh` (~30 LOC), `mow-worktree-remove.sh` (~15 LOC), `context-monitor.sh` (~25 LOC), `inject-project-context.sh` (~15 LOC). Registered in `.claude/settings.json`.
5. **commands/mow/auto.md** — The only new workflow file. Reads STATE.md for current position, sets `workflow.auto_advance: true`, invokes appropriate starting workflow with `--auto`.
6. **install.sh** — Remove WorkTrunk check and wt.toml creation. Add WorktreeCreate/WorktreeRemove hook registration.

**Key patterns:**
- Hooks handle only `.planning/` copy and STATUS.md init; coordination stays in mow-tools.cjs invoked explicitly by agents (not inside hooks).
- Workers pass file paths between lifecycle stages, never file contents — subagents write to disk, worker reads compact return values.
- Auto-advance survives context compaction because it persists to config.json, but this same persistence is a risk (stale flags); mitigated by clearing at session start.

See `.planning/research/v1.2-ARCHITECTURE.md` for full data flow diagrams, component boundary tables, and build-order dependency analysis.

### Critical Pitfalls

1. **Native worktree path mismatch destroys coordination** — Claude Code creates worktrees at `.claude/worktrees/<name>` with auto-generated slugs. Mowism's coordination layer expects `.worktrees/p{NN}`. Using `isolation: worktree` in agent frontmatter without a WorktreeCreate hook means workers start without `.planning/`, claim table tracks wrong paths, and merge operations target nonexistent branches. Prevention: use WorktreeCreate hook with naming convention filter (`p\d+` pattern) to control path and name. Keep `cmdWorktreeCreate` for coordination wrapper; replace only the internal `git worktree add` call.

2. **Simplification overshoot removes coordination layer** — The temptation to replace cmdWorktreeCreate entirely with native features removes 5 capabilities but native support only covers 1 (git worktree creation). Tracking, claiming, merging, stash/restore, and state copy have no native equivalents. Prevention: build a capabilities matrix before removing any code; only remove the `git worktree add` call; run integration tests before and after.

3. **Full-lifecycle workers accumulate 200k+ tokens across 4-5 subagent chains** — Workers collecting CONTEXT.md + RESEARCH.md + 4 PLANs + 4 SUMMARYs in context will trigger auto-compaction mid-lifecycle, causing workers to lose discuss decisions during execution. Prevention: subagents write to disk; worker receives only 1-2 line summaries + file paths (keep subagent returns under 500 tokens); route read-only stages to Haiku; checkpoint state to STATUS.md between stages.

4. **Discuss-phase bypassed in autonomous pipeline** — Two failure modes: (a) `AskUserQuestion` fails silently inside Task() subagent because it's not in an interactive terminal, and (b) stale `workflow.auto_advance: true` in config.json from a previous session causes discuss to chain directly to plan without pausing. Prevention: discuss runs INLINE in the worker (not as Task()), config.json auto_advance is cleared at team startup, and discuss-phase workflow checks for multi-agent context and never auto-advances in that mode regardless of flag.

5. **Skills/slash commands don't resolve in Task() subagents** — Full-lifecycle workers cannot invoke `/mow:plan-phase` or `/mow:discuss-phase` inside Task() calls. The subagent sees it as plain text. Prevention: workers run lifecycle stages inline via @file references (the same pattern already used for execute-phase). Only leaf operations (mow-executor per plan, mow-verifier, mow-phase-researcher) are delegated as Task().

6. **Nested subagent spawn causes OOM crash** — If plan-phase or discuss-phase workflow runs as a Task() subagent (not inline), its own Task() calls for researcher/checker subagents fail with OOM (enforced since v1.0.64). Prevention: strict 3-level hierarchy: lead -> worker (teammate, CAN use Task()) -> subagent (CANNOT spawn). Workers run orchestrating workflows inline; Task() only for leaf subagents.

7. **Auto-advance config persists across sessions, causing unexpected autonomous runs** — `workflow.auto_advance: true` written to config.json persists indefinitely. A new session may inherit it and run without pauses. Prevention: clear auto_advance at any session start that lacks explicit `--auto` flag; add visible banner when auto_advance is active; consider session-scoped transient flag instead of config.json persistence.

See `.planning/research/PITFALLS.md` for all 14 pitfalls with detection signals, recovery costs, and phase-specific warnings.

## Implications for Roadmap

Phase numbering continues from 12 (v1.1 ended at phase 12). Feature dependency chain: GSD bugfixes (independent) -> Native worktree adoption (foundation) -> Full-lifecycle workers (depends on worktrees) -> Auto-advance (depends on full-lifecycle workers). Bugfixes and native worktree adoption can be parallelized.

### Phase 13: GSD Bugfix Ports

**Rationale:** Fix correctness before building features. Nine confirmed bugs affect daily operation: data corruption (dollar sign, line 2131/2154/2186 in mow-tools.cjs), crashes (progress bar RangeError), infinite loops (executor no attempt limit), data loss (health --repair overwrites STATE.md), and tracking errors (todo lifecycle, requirement IDs, feature branch timing, subagent CLAUDE.md). These bugs will actively interfere with v1.2 development if not fixed first. They are also independent of all other v1.2 work and can be done in parallel with Phase 14.
**Delivers:** Corrected mow-tools.cjs (bugs 1, 2, 4, 7, 9 fixed), corrected workflow files (bugs 3, 5, 6, 8 fixed), and context window monitor hook (critical for Phase 15's long-running workers).
**Addresses:** All 9 must-port bugs plus context monitor (YES tier from should-consider list). Discuss-phase gray area looping deferred (P3).
**Avoids:** Pitfall 7 (GSD regression from code copy) — port logic not code, one commit per bug, test before fix.
**Group by locality:** State mutators (bugs 1, 7), workflow guards (bugs 3, 5, 6), init functions (bugs 2, 8), new state features (bug 9), progress fixes (bug 4), new hook (context monitor).

### Phase 14: Native Worktree Adoption

**Rationale:** Infrastructure foundation that unblocks Phase 15. Path references to `.worktrees/pNN` permeate ~30-40 locations across mow-tools.cjs, agent files, and workflows. WorkTrunk dependency must be fully removed. This is the largest code change in v1.2 (removing ~200 LOC of cmdWorktreeCreate/manifest/WorkTrunk) and needs to complete and stabilize before full-lifecycle workers depend on the coordination layer. Can be parallelized with Phase 13 since they touch different code sections.
**Delivers:** WorktreeCreate/WorktreeRemove hook scripts, slimmed mow-tools.cjs (~200 LOC removed from worktree creation, ~30 LOC added for native-aware coordination), WorkTrunk removed from install.sh and README, coordination layer adapted for native worktree path discovery (`git worktree list` instead of manifest-based path lookup).
**Uses:** Claude Code WorktreeCreate/WorktreeRemove hooks (v2.1.50), SubagentStart hook for CLAUDE.md injection.
**Avoids:** Pitfall 1 (path mismatch) — WorktreeCreate hook controls path, keeps `.worktrees/p{NN}` naming. Pitfall 2 (simplification overshoot) — capabilities matrix built first; only git worktree creation step replaced. Pitfall 8 (hook fires for all subagents) — naming convention filter (`p\d+` pattern) in hook. Pitfall 12 (stdout convention mismatch) — hook script outputs ONLY the absolute path on stdout.

### Phase 15: Full-Lifecycle Workers

**Rationale:** Core capability of v1.2. Depends on Phase 14 (workers need functional native worktrees). Rewrites mow-phase-worker.md to chain all lifecycle stages via sequential Task() calls, with mandatory discuss pause, resume-awareness, and disk-first context passing. This is the highest-complexity change in v1.2 — it fundamentally changes how phases are processed and has the most pitfalls.
**Delivers:** mow-phase-worker.md rewrite (Steps 2-5 as subagent Task() chain), mow-executor.md strengthened attempt limit, cost-aware model routing per stage (Haiku for research, executor_model for execution, verifier_model for refinement), resume-awareness at each stage, stage transition messaging to lead's dashboard.
**Implements:** 3-level hierarchy (lead -> worker/teammate -> subagent). Workers run discuss/plan workflows INLINE via @file references. Task() used only for mow-executor, mow-verifier, mow-phase-researcher as leaf subagents.
**Avoids:** Pitfall 3 (context accumulation) — disk-first return values, Haiku routing for read-only stages. Pitfall 4 (discuss bypass) — discuss runs inline, never as Task(). Pitfall 5 (skills not resolving) — @file references for workflow injection. Pitfall 9 (nested OOM) — strict 3-level enforcement, inline orchestration. Pitfall 11 (stale .planning/) — workers read ROADMAP.md/config.json from main worktree absolute path.
**Research flag:** This phase should run `/mow:research-phase` to explore the exact implementation pattern for inline workflow execution inside a teammate session, especially the @file reference behavior and discuss-phase interaction model in multi-agent context.

### Phase 16: Auto-Advance Pipeline

**Rationale:** Capstone feature. Depends on Phase 15 (auto-advance chains full lifecycle per phase; if workers only execute, there is nothing new to chain). The pipeline machinery already exists distributed across four workflow files — this phase is primarily a thin entry point plus safety guardrails. Relatively low complexity but requires full-lifecycle workers to validate the discuss-pause gate behavior.
**Delivers:** `commands/mow/auto.md` (the only new file in all of v1.2), `init auto` compound command in mow-tools.cjs (~40 LOC), auto-advance progress banner in dashboard, session-scoped auto_advance flag cleanup (clear at team startup and non-`--auto` session starts), cost/duration awareness warnings, milestone boundary stop enforcement.
**Addresses:** Cross-phase auto-advance, DAG-aware downstream phase auto-start, partial phase-range auto-advance (`/mow:auto 3 7`).
**Avoids:** Pitfall 4 (discuss bypass in auto mode) — guard added in full-lifecycle workers phase, enforced here. Pitfall 6 (runaway pipeline) — cost estimation before start, duration limits per phase. Pitfall 10 (stale auto_advance config) — session cleanup at any non-`--auto` start.

### Phase Ordering Rationale

- **GSD bugfixes first**: Correctness bugs (crashes, data corruption) that affect daily use must be fixed before building new features on top. The context window monitor bug specifically matters for full-lifecycle workers in Phase 15.
- **Bugfixes and native worktrees parallelizable**: They touch disjoint code sections (mow-tools.cjs state/workflow fixes vs. worktree creation code). Can run as separate plans in the same phase or as parallel phases if the DAG supports it.
- **Native worktrees before full-lifecycle workers**: Workers need functional worktree isolation before their lifecycle can expand. Path references, hook firing, and coordination layer correctness must be established first.
- **Full-lifecycle workers before auto-advance**: Auto-advance chains the full lifecycle. Until workers actually run all stages, `/mow:auto` just chains existing single-stage workers (equivalent to what already exists with `--auto`).
- **No new files except one**: The research confirms that all features fit into existing components with modifications. The only net-new file is `commands/mow/auto.md`. This is the clearest indicator that v1.2 is a simplification milestone.

### Research Flags

**Needs research-phase during planning:**
- **Phase 15 (Full-Lifecycle Workers):** The inline workflow execution pattern inside a teammate session, @file reference behavior in Task() prompts, and discuss-phase user interaction model in multi-agent context are not fully documented. The interaction between `input_needed` messages and auto-advance config needs validation. Run `/mow:research-phase` before planning this phase.

**Standard patterns (skip research-phase):**
- **Phase 13 (GSD Bugfixes):** Bugs are fully analyzed in v1.2-GSD-UPSTREAM-DIFF.md with specific file locations and fix patterns. Planning can proceed directly from research.
- **Phase 14 (Native Worktree Adoption):** Hook specs are verified from official Claude Code v2.1.50 docs. Implementation is straightforward translation of documented APIs. Planning can proceed directly.
- **Phase 16 (Auto-Advance Pipeline):** The mechanism is pre-built in existing workflows. The new work is a thin command + safety guardrails. Standard patterns, no research needed.

## Confidence Assessment

| Area | Confidence | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| Stack | HIGH | Claude Code 2.1.50 hook specs verified from official docs and local `claude --version`. jq soft dependency identified. All changes are to existing files; zero new npm dependencies. |
| Features | HIGH | 9 GSD bugs verified via local fork analysis (v1.2-GSD-UPSTREAM-DIFF.md). Feature dependency chain (bugfixes -> worktrees -> workers -> auto-advance) confirmed from codebase audit. Competitor analysis is MEDIUM confidence (Cursor/ADK docs, not primary). |
| Architecture | HIGH | Based on full codebase audit (8,208 LOC mow-tools.cjs, 14 agents, 33 workflows). Build order derived from actual code dependencies, not speculation. The "only new file is auto.md" conclusion is verifiable. |
| Pitfalls | HIGH | 14 pitfalls grounded in codebase analysis, official Claude Code docs, and v1.1 operational experience. Most critical pitfalls (1, 2, 3, 5, 9) are verifiable from current code paths. |

**Overall confidence: HIGH**

### Gaps to Address

- **Auto-advance persistence model**: Research identified that `workflow.auto_advance` in config.json is a risk (Pitfall 10). The recommended fix (session-scoped transient flag vs. TTL-stamped config) has not been decided. Validate the preferred approach during Phase 16 planning.
- **WorktreeCreate hook path convention decision**: Research recommends keeping `.worktrees/p{NN}` naming via the hook. An alternative is migrating to `.claude/worktrees/phase-NN`. Both are viable; the decision must be made before Phase 14 planning, as it affects ~30-40 path references. RECOMMENDATION: keep existing `.worktrees/p{NN}` naming to avoid unnecessary churn across all agent prompts.
- **Context monitor threshold tuning**: The 35%/25% thresholds for the PostToolUse context monitor are rough estimates based on transcript byte counting. The actual context window overhead (system prompt, tool definitions) makes these estimates imprecise. Thresholds need tuning after Phase 13 ships.
- **Phase 15 inline workflow execution**: Whether workers execute discuss-phase/plan-phase steps by reading @file references inline vs. spawning typed Task() subagents needs validation. Research recommends inline, but the exact implementation pattern is not documented. This is the primary unknown for v1.2.
