# Project Research Summary

**Project:** Mowism v1.3 — tmux Multi-Agent Execution
**Domain:** tmux-based multi-process orchestration, replacing Claude Code Agent Teams with direct `claude` CLI processes in tmux panes
**Researched:** 2026-02-25
**Confidence:** HIGH (all four research areas grounded in verified local installs, official docs, and confirmed GitHub issue evidence)

---

## Executive Summary

Mowism v1.3 replaces the experimental Claude Code Agent Teams subprocess model with a more robust architecture: a Node.js orchestrator that spawns separate interactive `claude` CLI processes in tmux panes, coordinating them through file-based STATUS.md signals rather than in-process messaging. The architectural insight driving this change is that **the orchestrator does not need to be an LLM**. DAG resolution, worktree management, tmux session control, and merge sequencing are all deterministic operations that Node.js handles without spending tokens. Replacing the Claude-agent orchestrator with a Node.js process eliminates the ~800k token cost of multi-agent coordination, the 200k context window exhaustion problem, and all limitations inherent to the experimental Agent Teams API (no session resume, no nested teams, one team per session, slow shutdown).

The stack requires zero new npm dependencies and zero new system dependencies. tmux is already installed at v3.6a. The full implementation uses Node.js built-ins (`child_process.execSync` for tmux commands, `fs.watch` for STATUS.md watching), the Claude CLI's existing flags (`--system-prompt`, `--agent`, `--append-system-prompt`, `--session-id`), and tmux's own session/pane/hook API. The critical environment variable override — passing `-e CLAUDECODE=""` to `tmux split-window` — is the single most important technical finding: Claude Code sets `CLAUDECODE=1` in its process tree, and any child `claude` process that inherits it refuses to start. This one flag enables the entire architecture.

The major risk is process lifecycle complexity: orphaned `claude` processes after orchestrator crashes, tmux session name collisions, git lock file conflicts from concurrent worktrees, and resource exhaustion (270-370MB RAM per worker). All of these have documented mitigations from prior art (Agent Farm, claude-squad, NTM, Overmind). The recommended approach is defense-in-depth: deterministic session naming with collision detection, PID manifests for orphan cleanup, orchestrator-driven (not hook-driven) worktree cleanup, staggered worker startup, and a configurable `max_workers` cap defaulting to 3.

---

## Key Findings

### Recommended Stack

v1.3 adds no new dependencies. The entire implementation uses what is already installed and already in mow-tools.cjs.

**Core technologies:**

- **tmux 3.6a** (already installed) — session/pane lifecycle, PTY allocation for interactive `claude` sessions, per-pane user options for metadata, `pane-died`/`pane-exited` hooks for exit detection, `wait-for` for synchronization. Use `split-window "command"` (not `send-keys`) to avoid the shell initialization race condition.
- **Node.js `child_process.execSync`** (v25.4.0, built-in) — issue tmux commands from the orchestrator. Synchronous is appropriate for tmux queries (they complete in milliseconds). Already used throughout mow-tools.cjs.
- **Node.js `fs.watch`** (v25.4.0, built-in) — watch STATUS.md files for worker completion signals. Uses Linux inotify (event-driven, zero CPU when idle). Recursive watching supported since Node v19.1.0. Add `fs.watchFile` polling fallback with 5-second interval for inotify limit edge cases. Do NOT use chokidar (adds dependency for zero benefit) or inotifywait (external binary, not installed).
- **Claude CLI 2.1.53** (already installed) — worker agent processes. Use `--system-prompt` or `--append-system-prompt` for dynamic phase context injection. Use `--agent execute` for standardized worker templates. Always interactive mode (not `--print`): workers need multi-step tool-using sessions; `--print` exits after one response. Use `--session-id mow-phase-NN` for crash recovery via `--resume`.
- **`-e CLAUDECODE=""`** (tmux flag) — the critical env override. Claude Code sets `CLAUDECODE=1` in its process tree. All `tmux split-window` and `tmux new-window` commands MUST include this flag or spawned `claude` processes will refuse to start.

**What to explicitly NOT use:**

| Rejected | Why |
|----------|-----|
| `claude --tmux` flag | Creates its own tmux session, conflicts with Mowism's session management |
| `tmux send-keys` for initial commands | Race condition with shell initialization (Claude Code issue #23513) |
| `claude -p` / `--print` for workers | Exits after one response; discuss-phase needs interactive sessions |
| `--dangerously-skip-permissions` as default | Unsafe; use `--permission-mode default` or `acceptEdits` |
| chokidar, node-pty, blessed, ink | External dependencies; tmux + built-in Node.js cover everything |
| Agent Teams API | Experimental, documented limitations, zero session resume |

### Expected Features

Research from competitor analysis (Claude Squad, NTM, Agent Farm, Overmind, Agent of Empires, Claude Dashboard) established clear category expectations.

**Must have (table stakes):**

- **Programmatic tmux session/window creation** — every tool in this space does it; users expect `mow-tools` to handle tmux lifecycle, not manual commands
- **Named panes for identification** — `tmux select-pane -T "Phase-{NN}: {name}"` so users know which pane is which phase
- **Spawn `claude` CLI in each worker pane** — the core value proposition; each pane runs a separate interactive `claude` instance in its own worktree
- **Detach-safe execution** — tmux sessions survive terminal closure by default; workers continue even if the user disconnects
- **Nested tmux detection** — if `$TMUX` is set, create a new window in the existing session; never force-nest; document `Ctrl+B Ctrl+B` double-prefix workaround
- **Fallback for non-tmux environments** — if tmux unavailable, fall back to sequential mode with a clear message
- **Session cleanup on completion** — `tmux kill-session` as the final close-shop step (or keep alive for user review)
- **Main-vertical layout** — orchestrator pane left (always visible), workers stacked right; switch to tiled for 4+ workers
- **Click-to-focus pane selection** — `tmux set-option -g mouse on`; fundamental tmux interaction
- **Input-needed notification in orchestrator** — worker writes `awaiting_input` to STATUS.md; orchestrator pane shows pinned notification with pane reference
- **Process exit detection** — `remain-on-exit on` + poll `#{pane_dead}` to detect crashed workers
- **Graceful SIGINT handling** — orchestrator traps SIGINT, sends `C-c` to all worker panes, then `kill-session`

**Should have (differentiators over Agent Teams and competitors):**

- **Node.js orchestrator (not Claude agent)** — unlimited state, zero token cost, instant startup, standard debugging
- **Dynamic layout switching based on worker count** — `main-vertical` for 2, `tiled` for 3-4, `main-horizontal` for 5-6
- **Phase-colored pane borders** — `tmux select-pane -P 'border-fg=colour{N}'` using Mowism's existing 256-color palette
- **Worker respawn in same pane position** — `tmux respawn-pane -k -t {pane_id}` after crash; preserves layout
- **DAG-aware pane lifecycle** — spawn workers only when their phase dependencies are satisfied; reclaim pane slots after merge
- **Stall detection** — `tmux set-option monitor-silence 300` alerts when a pane has no activity for 5 minutes
- **Tmux status bar integration** — show aggregate progress via `status-right '#(mow-tools.cjs tmux status-line)'`
- **Context exhaustion handling** — v1.2 hook fires at 25% remaining; orchestrator respawns worker in same pane with checkpoint resume
- **Orchestrator-controlled session naming** — `mow-{project_slug}-{milestone}` stored in config.json for resume detection
- **Configurable max_workers** — default 3; stored in `.planning/config.json` under `tmux.max_workers`

**Defer (v2+):**

- TUI session list (claude-squad style) — tmux pane layout IS the TUI
- Token velocity / cost tracking per pane — NTM has this; not needed for Mowism's orchestration focus
- Web-based monitoring dashboard — explicitly rejected in v1.0 research; CLI-first
- Multi-session per milestone — one session = one milestone; multiple sessions add discovery complexity
- Custom keybinding overlay — conflicts with user tmux configs; use mow-tools subcommands instead

### Architecture Approach

The orchestrator is a Node.js process (mow-tools.cjs `tmux orchestrate` subcommand group), not a Claude agent. It reads the DAG from ROADMAP.md (existing `analyzeDagInternal`), groups phases into waves (existing `topoGenerations`), creates git worktrees (existing `cmdWorktreeCreateNative`), spawns interactive `claude` processes in tmux panes via `split-window "command" -e CLAUDECODE=""`, watches STATUS.md files for completion signals, serializes git merges between waves, and spawns the next wave. The orchestrator runs in the user's terminal (not a tmux pane); workers run in tmux panes. The orchestrator can crash and the workers continue — the tmux session persists, and `mow-tools.cjs tmux resume` re-reads STATE.md and re-attaches watchers.

**Major components:**

1. **`tmuxSessionManager`** — thin `execSync` wrapper around tmux CLI commands (new-session, split-window, list-panes, kill-session, display-message). Handles `$TMUX` detection (create new window if already inside tmux). All split-window calls include `-d` (no focus theft) and `-e CLAUDECODE=""`.
2. **`cmdTmuxOrchestrate`** (main loop) — DAG analysis → wave grouping → worktree creation → pane spawning → fs.watch loop → merge → next wave → final report. Estimated ~200 LOC.
3. **`watchPhaseStatus`** — `fs.watch` on `.planning/phases/*/STATUS.md` with 100ms debounce and 5-second polling fallback. Parses STATUS.md for `status:` field values.
4. **File-based coordination protocol** — Workers write structured STATUS.md (`status: discussing|awaiting_input|researching|planning|executing|refining|complete|error`). Orchestrator watches these files. No in-process messaging, no shared mutable task list.
5. **Three-mode fallback chain** — tmux (default when available) → agent-teams (legacy, explicit config opt-in) → sequential (no tmux). Detection via `detectExecutionMode()` replacing current `checkAgentTeams()`.
6. **`auto.md` workflow integration** — Step 4 of auto.md gains a tmux branch: detect mode, call `mow-tools.cjs tmux orchestrate --all`, parse exit code.

**Estimated new code:** ~590 LOC in mow-tools.cjs (~7% of current 8,700 LOC). Worker agents (`mow-phase-worker.md`, `mow-executor.md`) and STATUS.md protocol are unchanged.

### Critical Pitfalls

Eight critical pitfalls identified, all with documented real-world precedents:

1. **send-keys race condition** — `tmux send-keys` arrives before shell initialization (Claude Code issue #23513, affects 2/4 agents on concurrent spawn per issue #23615). **Fix: always pass command as argument to `split-window "command"`** — never create an empty pane and send-keys.

2. **CLAUDECODE=1 env var blocker** — Claude Code sets this; spawned `claude` refuses to start without override. **Fix: `-e CLAUDECODE=""` on every `split-window`/`new-window` call.** Verified in tmux 3.6a and Claude Agent SDK issue #573.

3. **Nested tmux detection failure** — creating a new session from within tmux causes `sessions should be nested with care` error or silent failure. **Fix: check `$TMUX` at startup; use `new-window` if set, `new-session` if not.** Never force-nest.

4. **Orphaned `claude` processes** — orchestrator crash leaves workers running (270-370MB RAM each); tmux session persists. **Fix: defense-in-depth**: PID manifest → graceful SIGINT shutdown → startup detection of stale sessions (offer resume-or-kill) → deterministic session naming for discovery.

5. **Concurrent `.planning/` file writes** — multiple workers writing STATE.md or config.json simultaneously can corrupt data. **Fix: single-writer discipline**: workers write only to their worktree-local files; orchestrator is the sole writer for shared state; STATUS.md uses write-rename atomic pattern (write `.STATUS.md.tmp`, then `mv`).

6. **Focus theft during pane creation** — `split-window` switches focus to new pane by default; rapid spawning bounces focus and injects keystrokes into wrong panes. **Fix: `-d` flag on all `split-window` calls** (`-d` = don't focus new pane). Explicitly select orchestrator pane after all workers are spawned.

7. **Session name collision** — second `/mow:auto` invocation tries to create `mow-myproject` but it already exists; tmux attaches to stale session or errors. **Fix: `tmux has-session` check before creation**; name as `mow-{project_slug}-{milestone}`; store active session name in config.json; offer resume-or-kill prompt if stale session found.

8. **Resource exhaustion** — 4 workers + subagents = 1.5-2GB RAM; concurrent API calls hit rate limits (429 errors). **Fix: default `max_workers: 3`; stagger worker startup by 5-10 seconds; warn user on spawn if RAM is tight; implement exponential backoff on 429**.

## Implications for Roadmap

Based on combined research, the architecture file's own build-order suggestion is well-justified and should inform the roadmap phase structure directly. All 4 research files converge on the same dependency ordering.

### Phase 1: tmux Session Management Foundation

**Rationale:** Everything else depends on reliable session/pane creation. The two most dangerous pitfalls (send-keys race, CLAUDECODE blocker) must be solved at this layer before any worker spawning is attempted. Phase 1 has no LLM dependencies — it's pure Node.js + tmux command wrappers.

**Delivers:** `tmuxSessionManager` with verified `split-window "command" -e CLAUDECODE="" -d` pattern; `$TMUX` detection for nested-session handling; session naming strategy (`mow-{slug}-{milestone}`); `has-session` collision detection; startup stale-session detection; PID manifest infrastructure; graceful SIGINT handler; `detect-execution-mode` replacing `checkAgentTeams`; CLI routing for `tmux` subcommand group.

**Features:** Programmatic session creation, named panes, nested tmux detection, fallback detection, `-d` no-focus-theft flag, staggered startup, `max_workers` config.

**Avoids:** send-keys race (use split-window "command"), CLAUDECODE blocker (-e flag), nested session failure ($TMUX check), focus theft (-d flag), session collision (has-session + naming).

**Research flag:** Standard tmux patterns — skip research-phase. All commands verified against local tmux 3.6a.

---

### Phase 2: Worker Spawning + File-Based Coordination

**Rationale:** Worker spawning depends on Phase 1 session management. File-based coordination replaces Agent Teams messaging and is the core protocol that all subsequent phases depend on. These two concerns are tightly coupled: workers spawn, write STATUS.md, orchestrator watches STATUS.md.

**Delivers:** `cmdTmuxSpawn` (single worker per pane with `--append-system-prompt` phase context); prompt file generation (`/tmp/mow-phase-NN-prompt.txt`); `watchPhaseStatus` (`fs.watch` + polling fallback); STATUS.md parser; completion callback; worktree-pane manifest extension (add `tmux_pane_id`, `tmux_session_name`); orchestrator-driven worktree cleanup (replaces hook-driven, addresses Pitfall 11); `remain-on-exit on` + dead-pane polling.

**Features:** Spawn `claude` CLI in each pane (interactive, not --print), detach-safe execution, process exit detection, file-based coordination protocol, `await_input` detection, worker respawn in same pane position.

**Avoids:** Using `--print` mode (multi-step lifecycle), capturing pane output for coordination (fragile), concurrent writes to shared `.planning/` files (single-writer discipline), WorktreeRemove hook reliability issue (orchestrator-driven cleanup instead).

**Research flag:** Needs integration testing — the `CLAUDECODE=""` override is documented but should be verified end-to-end in Mowism's specific mow-tools.cjs invocation chain (running inside Claude Code). `--session-id` + `--resume` flag behavior for crash recovery also needs empirical verification.

---

### Phase 3: Full Orchestration Loop

**Rationale:** The main orchestration loop integrates existing DAG analysis with tmux spawning and file-watching into a single cohesive pipeline. Depends on Phases 1 and 2. This is the phase that replaces the Agent Teams team lead.

**Delivers:** `cmdTmuxOrchestrate` (DAG → wave grouping → spawn → monitor → merge → next wave → final report); serialized merge queue (one merge at a time to avoid git lock conflicts); circuit breaker (configurable failure threshold); wave-boundary handling; `cmdTmuxResume` (re-read STATE.md + manifest, re-attach watchers after orchestrator crash); `cmdTmuxStatus` (query all worker statuses); `cmdTmuxKill`; dynamic layout selection by worker count.

**Features:** DAG-aware pane lifecycle, wave-based execution, orchestrator-controlled session naming, context exhaustion recovery (respawn from checkpoint), stall detection via `monitor-silence`, git lock file cleanup on startup.

**Avoids:** Orchestrator as Claude agent (Node.js instead → unlimited state, zero tokens), parsing pane output for coordination (STATUS.md is authoritative), concurrent git merges (serialized), `git gc`/`fetch`/`stash` in workers (orchestrator-only operations).

**Research flag:** Standard patterns from existing DAG scheduler — skip research-phase. Merge serialization is established in existing `cmdWorktreeMerge`.

---

### Phase 4: Workflow Integration

**Rationale:** Wire the tmux orchestrator into existing commands so users access it through familiar entry points (`/mow:auto`). Also adds user-facing convenience commands and disables Agent Teams as the default.

**Delivers:** Modified `auto.md` (Step 4 gains tmux branch: detect mode → call `mow-tools.cjs tmux orchestrate --all` → parse result); modified `execute-phase.md` (tmux parallel for 3+ plans); `/mow:tmux-status` command; `/mow:tmux-attach` for quick pane switching; close-shop integration (`kill-session` as final step); Agent Teams demoted to explicit opt-in (`config.execution_mode: "agent-teams"`).

**Features:** Three-mode fallback chain (tmux → agent-teams → sequential), `mow-tools tmux focus {phase}` for semantic pane switching, input-needed notifications with pane reference, agent prompt rewrite (remove Agent Teams tool references).

**Avoids:** Using Claude Code's `--tmux` flag (conflicts with Mowism session management), multiple tmux sessions per milestone (one session = one milestone), programmatic input injection via send-keys (user judgment required for prompts).

**Research flag:** Workflow file modification is standard — skip research-phase. Agent prompt rewrite (removing Agent Teams tool references) needs careful audit of all agent files.

---

### Phase 5: Polish, Theming, and Robustness

**Rationale:** Independent of core function. These features improve UX and robustness but do not block the orchestration pipeline. Defer until Phases 1-4 are proven.

**Delivers:** Per-pane border colors (existing Mowism 256-color palette via `tmux select-pane -P 'border-fg=colour{N}'`); pane-border-format with `@mow-phase`/`@mow-color` user options; tmux status bar integration (`status-right` showing aggregate progress); lifecycle stage column in dashboard (discuss/research/plan/execute/refine); terminal state cleanup wrapper (reset ANSI on `claude` crash); windows-per-worker option for 3+ agents on small screens; resource usage warning on spawn; backpressure on API 429 errors; `mow cleanup` command for stale sessions.

**Features:** Phase-colored pane borders, orchestrator pane as live dashboard, tmux status bar integration, pane title as real-time status, terminal corruption recovery, user confusion prevention (pane count vs screen size).

**Avoids:** Custom TUI framework (tmux is the TUI), scrollable agent list (defeats simultaneous visibility), tabbed pane switching (same problem), auto-dismiss notifications (persist until worker clears), auto-restart without user awareness.

**Research flag:** Border coloring and status bar patterns are well-documented in tmux 3.6a man page — skip research-phase. Terminal corruption reset sequence needs empirical testing with claude crash scenarios.

---

### Phase Ordering Rationale

- Session management (Phase 1) is foundational — every other phase depends on reliable pane creation with the correct env overrides and no focus theft
- Worker spawning + coordination (Phase 2) depends on Phase 1; these two are tightly coupled and can be built in the same milestone if scope allows
- Full orchestration (Phase 3) integrates Phases 1 and 2 with the existing DAG scheduler; this is the Agent Teams replacement
- Workflow integration (Phase 4) wires Phase 3 into user-facing commands; must come after Phase 3 is stable
- Polish (Phase 5) is independent of core function; the system is usable without it

### Research Flags

**Needs research-phase during planning:**
- Phase 2 (Worker Spawning): End-to-end integration testing of CLAUDECODE="" override in Mowism's specific invocation chain. Claude CLI `--session-id` + `--resume` behavior for interrupted sessions. Verify `--append-system-prompt` size limits for long phase prompts.
- Phase 4 (Workflow Integration): Agent file audit to identify all Agent Teams tool references that need removal (`SendMessage`, `TaskCreate`, `TaskUpdate`, `TaskList` usage in agent YAML and markdown files).

**Standard patterns — skip research-phase:**
- Phase 1: All tmux commands verified against local 3.6a install; Node.js execSync usage is established
- Phase 3: DAG scheduler already exists; merge serialization already in `cmdWorktreeMerge`; patterns well-documented
- Phase 5: tmux border/status bar API verified in man page; ANSI reset sequences are standard

## Confidence Assessment

| Area | Confidence | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| Stack (tmux API) | HIGH | Verified against installed tmux 3.6a man page, `list-commands`, and `--help` outputs |
| Stack (Claude CLI flags) | HIGH | Verified against `claude --help` from v2.1.53 on this machine |
| Stack (CLAUDECODE env var) | HIGH | Documented in Claude Agent SDK issue #573; confirmed in claude --help error message; pattern used by cmux project |
| Stack (fs.watch) | HIGH | Tested live on Node.js v25.4.0, both single-file and recursive modes |
| Features | MEDIUM-HIGH | tmux primitives stable; Mowism codebase analyzed; competitor tools verified via GitHub repos |
| Architecture | HIGH | Cross-checked between STACK.md and ARCHITECTURE.md researchers; four corrections applied |
| Pitfalls | HIGH | All critical pitfalls grounded in GitHub issues (Claude Code #23513, #23615, #11122; opencode #11225; tmux #3317) or tmux documentation |

**Overall confidence: HIGH**

### Gaps to Address

- **CLAUDECODE override end-to-end**: The bypass is documented and verified at the command level, but the full Mowism invocation chain (mow-tools.cjs running inside Claude Code → execSync → tmux split-window → claude) should be integration-tested early in Phase 2 before building the rest of the orchestration loop on top of it.
- **API rate limits under parallel load**: Anthropic's per-account rate limits (RPM, ITPM, OTPM) are not publicly documented precisely. The `max_workers: 3` default and staggered startup mitigate this, but empirical testing is needed to tune the startup stagger interval.
- **inotify watch limit on heavily-tooled dev machines**: Default is typically 65536+ on modern systems but can be lower. Should detect and warn if `max_user_watches` would be exhausted by Mowism's watchers plus the user's IDE/Docker watchers.
- **tmux socket isolation**: Should Mowism use a dedicated tmux socket (`-L mow`) for complete isolation from the user's tmux, or integrate into the user's existing session? Both work. Dedicated socket is cleaner for session management but requires a separate `tmux -L mow attach` to view workers. This is a UX preference decision that needs user-facing documentation.
- **Agent file audit scope**: The full count of agent files that reference Agent Teams tools (SendMessage, TaskCreate, TaskUpdate, TaskList) has not been enumerated. Phase 4 planning needs to count these and estimate the rewrite effort.
