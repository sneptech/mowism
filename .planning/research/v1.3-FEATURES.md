# Feature Landscape: v1.3 Tmux Multi-Agent Execution

**Domain:** Tmux-based multi-agent CLI orchestration -- replacing Agent Teams subprocesses with visible tmux panes running separate `claude` CLI sessions
**Researched:** 2026-02-25
**Confidence:** MEDIUM-HIGH (tmux primitives are stable and well-documented; ecosystem tools verified via GitHub repos and official docs; Claude Code Agent Teams tmux integration verified via official docs; Mowism existing architecture verified from local codebase)
**Scope:** NEW features for v1.3 only. Existing features documented in `FEATURES.md`, `v1.1-FEATURES.md`, and `v1.2-FEATURES.md`.

## Context

Mowism v1.2 shipped with full-lifecycle workers, auto-advance pipeline, and native worktree adoption. Workers currently run as Agent Teams subprocesses -- invisible to the user unless split-pane mode is enabled in tmux. v1.3 replaces this invisible execution model with explicit tmux panes where each worker gets its own visible `claude` CLI session, enabling:

1. **User visibility** -- see what every agent is doing at a glance
2. **Direct interaction** -- click into any pane to answer prompts, give guidance, or debug
3. **Input routing** -- when a worker needs user input, the user can switch to that pane directly
4. **Status aggregation** -- orchestrator pane shows aggregate progress while worker panes show detail
5. **Process lifecycle** -- spawn, monitor, restart crashed workers through tmux primitives

The v1.1 distributed input routing design (color-coded agent badges, rich notifications) was designed for this but never fully realized because Agent Teams in-process mode provides only Shift+Down cycling, not separate terminals.

## Competitor Analysis

Before categorizing features, here is what each reference tool actually does for tmux multi-agent management:

### Claude Code Agent Teams (Split-Pane Mode)

| Feature | How It Works |
|---------|-------------|
| Split-pane display | Each teammate gets its own tmux pane. User sees all output simultaneously. |
| In-process fallback | Without tmux, uses Shift+Up/Down to cycle between teammate views in one terminal. |
| Auto-detection | `teammateMode: "auto"` uses split panes if already in tmux, in-process otherwise. |
| Direct interaction | Click into a pane to interact with that teammate's full Claude Code session. |
| Permission bubbling | Teammate permission requests bubble up to the lead terminal. |
| No layout control | Claude Code creates panes automatically; no user control over layout. |
| No status aggregation | Lead terminal shows task list but no aggregate dashboard. |

**What Agent Teams Split-Pane does NOT have:**
- No orchestrator-controlled layout (panes created ad-hoc by Claude Code)
- No status dashboard separate from lead conversation
- No process crash detection/restart
- No color-coded pane identification
- No programmatic pane lifecycle management

### Claude Squad

| Feature | How It Works |
|---------|-------------|
| TUI session list | Scrollable list of sessions with preview. Navigate with j/k, attach with Enter. |
| Git worktree isolation | Each session gets its own worktree branch. |
| Preview + diff toggle | Tab key toggles between output preview and git diff of changes. |
| Checkpoint workflow | `c` to checkout, `s` to commit/push, `D` to delete session. |
| No tmux pane layout | Sessions are separate tmux sessions, not panes in one window. User attaches to one at a time. |
| No orchestration layer | Pure session management. No task coordination, no DAG, no planning. |

### NTM (Named Tmux Manager)

| Feature | How It Works |
|---------|-------------|
| Multi-agent spawn | `ntm spawn myproject --cc=4 --cod=4 --gmi=2` creates 10 agents + 1 user pane in tiled layout. |
| Broadcast commands | `ntm send myproject --cc "fix errors"` sends to all Claude agents. |
| Command palette | F6 opens fuzzy-searchable prompt palette. |
| Token velocity badges | Real-time tokens-per-minute display per agent. |
| Conflict tracking | Detects when agents modify the same files. |
| Output capture | Extract and filter pane output by regex, code blocks, or agent type. |
| No planning layer | No phases, no DAG, no lifecycle stages. Pure multi-agent terminal management. |

### Claude Code Agent Farm

| Feature | How It Works |
|---------|-------------|
| 20-50 agent scale | Python orchestrator manages large fleets of Claude Code instances. |
| Dedicated controller pane | Separate tmux pane runs dashboard showing all agent states. |
| File-based state | JSON files track agent status with file locking for concurrent access. |
| Heartbeat monitoring | Continuous health checks detect stalled/crashed agents. |
| Auto-restart | Agents restart on task completion or error with adaptive idle timeouts. |
| Broadcast controls | Ctrl+R sends `/clear` to all agents. |
| Context auto-clear | Agents clear context when nearing token limits. |

### Claude Dashboard (k9s-style)

| Feature | How It Works |
|---------|-------------|
| Table display | k9s-inspired table showing Name, Status, CPU/Memory, Uptime, Path, Project. |
| Multi-source detection | Finds Claude sessions in managed tmux sessions, named sessions, process tree, terminal tabs. |
| Status indicators | Active (streaming), Idle (at prompt), Waiting (input expected), Terminal (read-only). |
| Vim navigation | j/k navigation, Enter to attach, K to kill, / to filter, l for history. |
| Bulk cleanup | Ctrl+K kills all idle sessions. |

### Overmind (Process Manager)

| Feature | How It Works |
|---------|-------------|
| Tmux-backed processes | Each Procfile process runs in its own tmux window. Output captured via tmux control mode. |
| `overmind connect` | Attach to any process's tmux window for interactive debugging/input. |
| `overmind restart` | Restart individual processes without affecting others. Supports wildcards. |
| Can-die processes | Designate processes that can exit without killing the whole stack. |
| Auto-restart option | Processes can be configured to auto-restart on exit. |
| Aggregated output | Main terminal shows interleaved, color-labeled output from all processes. |

### Agent of Empires

| Feature | How It Works |
|---------|-------------|
| Dual view modes | Toggle between agent view (AI output) and terminal view (shell) with `t`. |
| Status detection | Detects running, waiting for input, or idle states from pane content. |
| Diff view | `D` shows code diffs for review within the TUI. |
| Multi-agent support | Claude Code, OpenCode, Mistral, Codex, Gemini, Cursor. |
| Docker sandboxing | Optional isolation per agent. |

### Concurrently / npm-run-all

| Feature | How It Works |
|---------|-------------|
| Prefixed output | Each process output prefixed with name/index/PID for identification. |
| `--aggregate-output` | Delays output until process completes to prevent interleaving. |
| `--max-parallel` | Limits concurrent processes. |
| Color-coded labels | Each process gets a distinct color prefix. |

---

## 1. Session Management

How to create, manage, and coordinate tmux sessions for multi-agent execution.

### Table Stakes

| Feature | Why Expected | Complexity | Depends On | Notes |
|---------|--------------|------------|------------|-------|
| **Programmatic tmux session/window creation** | Every tool in this space (NTM, Agent Farm, claude-squad, Overmind) creates tmux sessions programmatically. Users expect `mow-tools` to handle tmux lifecycle, not manual `tmux split-window` commands. | LOW | tmux installed in PATH | Use `tmux new-session`, `tmux split-window`, `tmux send-keys` commands from mow-tools.cjs via child_process. No tmux library dependency needed -- raw CLI commands are the standard pattern (NTM, Agent Farm, Overmind all do this). |
| **Named panes/windows for identification** | NTM names panes (`myproject__cc_1`), Overmind names windows by Procfile process, claude-tmux identifies sessions by Claude process. Without names, users cannot tell which pane belongs to which phase. | LOW | Session creation | Use `tmux select-pane -T "Phase-{NN}: {name}"` to set pane title. Titles visible in tmux status bar and via `tmux list-panes -F '#{pane_title}'`. |
| **Spawn `claude` CLI in each worker pane** | The core value proposition. Each pane runs a separate `claude` instance with the worker's agent prompt and worktree context. Agent Teams does this automatically in split-pane mode; Mowism needs to do it explicitly to control the layout and lifecycle. | MEDIUM | Worktree creation (v1.2), agent prompt generation | `tmux send-keys -t {pane_id} 'cd {worktree_path} && claude --agent-file {worker_agent} --prompt "{initial_prompt}"' Enter`. The initial prompt must include phase context, resume state, and worker instructions. |
| **Detach-safe execution** | Users must be able to close their terminal or detach from tmux without killing workers. This is fundamental tmux behavior but must be preserved -- no foreground process dependencies. Overmind, Agent Farm, and claude-squad all support this. | LOW | tmux (built-in) | tmux sessions survive detachment by default. Workers run as `claude` processes inside tmux panes. No special handling needed unless using pipes or process groups that die on HUP. |
| **Session cleanup on completion** | When all workers finish and merges complete, the tmux session should be cleaned up. Orphaned tmux sessions are a known problem (Agent Teams docs warn about this). Claude Dashboard offers Ctrl+K to kill idle sessions. | LOW | Completion detection | `tmux kill-session -t {session_name}` after close-shop workflow completes. Or keep alive with a summary pane if user prefers to review. Add to close-shop workflow. |
| **Fallback for non-tmux environments** | Users in VS Code integrated terminal, Windows Terminal, or Ghostty cannot use tmux split-pane mode (Agent Teams docs confirm this limitation). Must fall back gracefully. | LOW | `$TMUX` env var check | Check `$TMUX` environment variable or `tmux has-session`. If unavailable, fall back to sequential execution or Agent Teams in-process mode (Shift+Up/Down). Print clear message: "tmux not detected, running sequentially." |
| **Nested tmux detection** | If the user is already in a tmux session, creating a new session causes nested tmux conflicts (double prefix keys, `$TMUX` confusion). Overmind documents this problem explicitly. | LOW | `$TMUX` env var | If `$TMUX` is set, create a new WINDOW in the existing session instead of a new session. Or use `tmux new-session -d` to create a detached session and attach only the orchestrator pane. Document the `Ctrl+B Ctrl+B` double-prefix workaround. |

### Differentiators

| Feature | Value Proposition | Complexity | Depends On | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|------------|------------|-------|
| **Orchestrator as tmux session owner** | Mowism's lead orchestrator creates and owns the tmux session. Unlike Agent Teams (where Claude Code manages panes internally) or claude-squad (where the TUI manages sessions), Mowism's lead agent programmatically controls the entire layout. This enables DAG-aware pane spawning -- spawn worker panes only when a phase is unblocked, not all at once. No other tool combines orchestration intelligence with tmux layout control. | MEDIUM | tmux session creation, DAG scheduler (v1.1) | The lead runs in its own pane (the "orchestrator pane") and uses `tmux split-window` to spawn worker panes as phases become ready. This is the overmind connect pattern applied to AI agents: a central coordinator that owns the process topology. |
| **Agent Teams removal -- direct `claude` CLI spawning** | v1.2 uses Agent Teams (experimental, known limitations: no session resume, slow shutdown, one team per session). v1.3 replaces Agent Teams with direct `claude --agent-file --worktree --prompt` invocations in tmux panes. This eliminates the experimental dependency and its limitations while gaining full process control. Mowism becomes the coordination layer instead of delegating to Agent Teams. | HIGH | Full rewrite of team-lead messaging to file-based protocol | The biggest architectural change. Workers currently communicate via Agent Teams SendMessage/TaskUpdate. Must be replaced with file-based STATUS.md protocol (already designed in v1.1) plus tmux `capture-pane` for status detection. |
| **Worktree-per-pane mapping with manifest tracking** | Each tmux pane maps 1:1 to a worktree and a phase. The manifest (already built in v1.2) tracks this mapping: `{pane_id, worktree_path, phase_number, pid, status}`. No other tool maintains a structured mapping between panes, worktrees, and orchestration state. NTM tracks panes but has no worktree or phase concept. | MEDIUM | Worktree manifest (v1.2), pane creation | Extend manifest JSON to include `tmux_pane_id` and `tmux_session_name`. Lead queries manifest to find pane for any phase. |

### Anti-Features

| Anti-Feature | Why Avoid | What to Do Instead |
|--------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Building a custom TUI (ratatui/blessed/ink)** | Claude Dashboard, Agent of Empires, claude-tmux, and claude-squad all build custom TUIs in Rust/Go/Node. Building a TUI is a significant engineering effort (claude-tmux is 3,000+ lines of Rust). Mowism's value is orchestration intelligence, not terminal rendering. The lead agent IS the TUI -- it prints the dashboard. | Use tmux native features (pane titles, `capture-pane`, layout commands) plus mow-tools.cjs formatting (already has `format banner`, `format banner-phase`, `dashboard render`). The orchestrator pane prints the dashboard; worker panes show Claude Code's native output. |
| **Replacing Agent Teams' task list with a custom concurrent task queue** | Agent Teams' shared task list with file-locking is well-engineered. Reimplementing concurrent task claiming, dependency tracking, and self-assignment is complex and error-prone. | Use file-based coordination through STATUS.md (single-writer, already built) and dashboard events (already built). Workers write STATUS.md; lead reads it. No shared mutable task list needed -- the lead assigns work via initial prompt, not a claimable queue. |
| **Supporting multiple tmux sessions per milestone** | NTM supports multiple labeled swarms (`ntm spawn frontend`, `ntm spawn backend`). For Mowism, one tmux session per milestone is sufficient -- phases within a milestone already coordinate via DAG. Multiple sessions add session discovery complexity for no clear benefit. | One tmux session = one milestone execution. All worker panes live in one session. Lead's orchestrator pane is always pane 0. |
| **Using Claude Code's `--tmux` flag for spawning** | Claude Code's `--tmux` flag creates its OWN tmux session, which conflicts with Mowism's session management. Two competing session managers = chaos. | Mowism creates and manages its own tmux session. Workers spawn as `claude --agent-file ...` without `--tmux`. Mowism owns the tmux layout. |

---

## 2. Pane Layout Patterns

How to arrange the orchestrator and worker panes for 2-6 concurrent processes.

### Table Stakes

| Feature | Why Expected | Complexity | Depends On | Notes |
|---------|--------------|------------|------------|-------|
| **Main-vertical layout: orchestrator left, workers stacked right** | The `main-vertical` tmux layout is the established pattern for orchestrator+workers. The left pane (wide) shows the lead/dashboard. The right column shows worker panes stacked vertically. Overmind uses this implicitly. oh-my-opencode-slim's tmux integration spawns monitoring panes alongside the main session. This matches how developers already use tmux for "editor + terminals" workflows. | LOW | tmux session creation | `tmux select-layout main-vertical` after creating panes. Set `main-pane-width` to ~40% for orchestrator, 60% for workers. For 2-3 workers, stacked right column is readable. For 4-6, consider tiled layout (see differentiator below). |
| **Orchestrator pane always visible** | The orchestrator pane shows aggregate progress (dashboard), pinned notifications, and input-needed alerts. It must always be visible, never obscured by worker panes. Every orchestrator tool (Agent Farm's controller window, NTM's dashboard, Overmind's main terminal) keeps the coordinator visible at all times. | LOW | Layout selection | The orchestrator pane is the main pane in `main-vertical` or `main-horizontal` layout. It never gets split or replaced. |
| **Worker pane identification** | Users must know which pane is which phase at a glance. Options: tmux pane titles (shown in status bar), colored banners (already built: `format banner-phase`), or both. NTM uses color-coded agent cards. claude-tmux uses status indicators. Concurrently uses color-coded prefixes. | LOW | Banner formatting (v1.1) | Already built: `mow-tools.cjs format banner-phase --phase {N}` prints a colored full-width banner. Each worker prints this on startup. Additionally, set `tmux select-pane -T "Phase {N}: {name}"` for the tmux status bar. |
| **Pane zoom for focused interaction** | When a user needs to answer a prompt or debug a worker, they need to zoom into that pane (full-screen it temporarily). This is built into tmux: `Ctrl+B z` toggles zoom. claude-tmux mentions zoom. NTM supports zoom without losing session state. | LOW | tmux (built-in) | No implementation needed. tmux native `prefix z` handles this. Document the keybinding in Mowism help. Optionally expose `mow-tools tmux zoom {phase}` as a convenience wrapper around `tmux resize-pane -Z -t {pane_id}`. |

### Differentiators

| Feature | Value Proposition | Complexity | Depends On | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|------------|------------|-------|
| **Dynamic layout switching based on worker count** | 2 workers: `main-vertical` (orchestrator left, 2 stacked right). 3-4 workers: `tiled` (all panes roughly equal, orchestrator labeled). 5-6 workers: `main-horizontal` (orchestrator top, workers in bottom row). No other tool dynamically adjusts layout based on agent count. NTM uses static tiled. Agent Farm uses a flat tmux session. | LOW | Worker count from DAG analysis | Simple switch statement: `if (workerCount <= 2) 'main-vertical'; else if (workerCount <= 4) 'tiled'; else 'main-horizontal'`. Apply with `tmux select-layout {layout}`. Adjust `main-pane-width` or `main-pane-height` proportionally. |
| **Phase-colored pane borders** | tmux supports `pane-border-style` and `pane-active-border-style` with ANSI colors. Combined with Mowism's existing phase color palette (v1.1: green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan), each pane border matches its phase color. At a glance, users see which pane is which phase without reading text. No other tool uses per-pane border colors for agent identification. | LOW | Phase color palette (v1.1) | `tmux select-pane -t {pane_id} -P 'border-fg=colour{N}'` where colour{N} matches the phase's ANSI color from `format banner-phase`. Requires tmux 3.2+ for per-pane styles -- verify version on target systems. |
| **Orchestrator pane as live dashboard** | The orchestrator's main pane does not show a Claude Code conversation -- it shows the Mowism dashboard (active phases table, event log, pinned notifications, auto-advance progress). This is rendered by `mow-tools.cjs dashboard render` at intervals or on events. Similar to Agent Farm's controller window or k9s-style claude-dashboard, but integrated into the orchestration flow rather than being a separate monitoring tool. | MEDIUM | Dashboard render (v1.1), event system (v1.1) | Two options: (A) The lead agent periodically calls `dashboard render` and prints to its pane. (B) A standalone watch loop: `watch -n 5 -c 'node ~/.claude/mowism/bin/mow-tools.cjs dashboard render'`. Option A integrates with lead's event-driven flow; Option B is simpler but decoupled from orchestration. |

### Anti-Features

| Anti-Feature | Why Avoid | What to Do Instead |
|--------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Custom pane layout engine** | NTM builds a "flexbox-inspired" layout system. laio (Rust) builds a custom layout engine. These are complex, fragile, and duplicate what tmux already provides with 5 built-in layouts plus `main-pane-width`/`main-pane-height` tuning. | Use tmux's built-in layouts (`main-vertical`, `main-horizontal`, `tiled`). Tune with `main-pane-width`. Simple, robust, zero maintenance. |
| **Scrollable agent list (TUI pattern)** | Claude-squad and claude-tmux use scrollable lists where you see one agent at a time. This hides agents. The whole point of tmux panes is simultaneous visibility. | Show all panes simultaneously in the tmux layout. If there are more workers than fit visually (7+), use multiple tmux windows (tabs), not scrolling within one window. |
| **Tabbed pane switching** | Some tools use tabs within a pane to cycle between agents (Agent Teams in-process mode uses Shift+Up/Down). This defeats the purpose of visual parallelism. | All agents visible simultaneously in their own panes. User clicks into a pane or uses `Ctrl+B q {N}` to select. No internal tab cycling. |

---

## 3. User Interaction Patterns

How users switch between panes, answer prompts, and monitor progress.

### Table Stakes

| Feature | Why Expected | Complexity | Depends On | Notes |
|---------|--------------|------------|------------|-------|
| **Click-to-focus pane selection** | In tmux with `mouse on`, users click a pane to focus it and type. This is the dominant interaction pattern in every tmux-based multi-agent tool (Agent Teams split-pane, NTM, Agent Farm). Users expect to click a pane when they see activity or a prompt. | LOW | tmux mouse mode | `tmux set-option -g mouse on` in the session setup. Already the tmux default in modern configurations. |
| **Input-needed notification in orchestrator** | When a worker hits a prompt (permission, question, checkpoint), the orchestrator pane must show which worker needs input and why. This was designed in v1.1 (color-coded badges, rich notifications) but not fully implemented because Agent Teams in-process mode lacked separate terminals. v1.3 realizes this design. | MEDIUM | Dashboard events (v1.1), worker STATUS.md protocol | Workers write `input_needed` events to their STATUS.md. The lead polls STATUS.md files (or watches file changes) and renders notifications in the orchestrator pane. Format already designed in the v1.1 distributed-input-routing todo. |
| **Direct typing into worker pane** | When a worker's Claude Code session shows a prompt (permission, question, `[y/n]`), the user types directly into that pane. No intermediary. This is how tmux works by default -- the focused pane receives keystrokes. Agent Teams split-pane mode works this way too. | LOW | tmux (built-in) | No implementation needed. tmux's default behavior. The worker's `claude` process receives input from the pane's PTY. |
| **Return to orchestrator after interaction** | After answering a prompt in a worker pane, the user needs to get back to the orchestrator pane to see overall progress. Claude-squad uses Ctrl+Q to detach. Overmind uses Ctrl+B d. Standard tmux uses `Ctrl+B q 0` to select pane 0. | LOW | tmux (built-in) | Document `Ctrl+B q 0` or define a custom binding. Or provide `mow-tools tmux focus orchestrator` which calls `tmux select-pane -t {session}:0.0`. |

### Differentiators

| Feature | Value Proposition | Complexity | Depends On | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|------------|------------|-------|
| **Smart input routing with visual indicators** | When a worker needs input, three things happen: (1) the orchestrator dashboard shows a pinned notification with the worker's color badge, the type of input needed, and "switch to pane N", (2) the worker pane's border flashes or changes color to attract attention, (3) if the user is zoomed into another pane, the orchestrator notification persists until addressed. No other tool combines all three. NTM has color-coded cards but no notification routing. Agent Farm has heartbeat detection but no prompt-type awareness. | MEDIUM | Dashboard pinned notifications (v1.1), pane border colors, STATUS.md input_needed field | Worker sends structured `input_needed` message (already designed: type, options, mode, question text). Lead reads and renders. Pane border change: `tmux select-pane -t {pane} -P 'border-fg=colour196'` (red = needs input). Reset after input provided. |
| **`mow-tools tmux focus {phase}` command** | One-command pane switching. Instead of memorizing tmux pane numbers, the user types a quick command or the orchestrator tells them exactly what to run. Maps phase number to pane ID via manifest. NTM has numbered quick-select (1-9). Mowism maps by phase semantics, not pane position. | LOW | Manifest with pane IDs | `mow-tools.cjs tmux focus {phase_number}` looks up pane_id in manifest, calls `tmux select-pane -t {pane_id}`. Simple but high-UX-impact. |
| **Status detection from pane content** | claude-tmux detects Claude Code state by parsing pane content (`capture-pane`): "Working" (has interrupt message), "Idle" (prompt visible), "Waiting" (has `[y/n]`). Claude Dashboard does the same with Active/Idle/Waiting/Terminal states. Mowism can adopt this pattern to detect worker state without workers explicitly signaling -- a safety net for when STATUS.md updates lag. | MEDIUM | `tmux capture-pane`, status parsing logic | Periodic `tmux capture-pane -t {pane_id} -p` captures last N lines. Parse for known patterns: `[y/n]` = waiting, `ctrl+c to interrupt` = working, prompt character = idle. Cross-reference with STATUS.md for authoritative state but use capture-pane as fallback/validation. |

### Anti-Features

| Anti-Feature | Why Avoid | What to Do Instead |
|--------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Programmatic input injection via `tmux send-keys`** | It is tempting to have the orchestrator auto-answer prompts by sending keys to worker panes (`tmux send-keys -t {pane} 'y' Enter`). This is fragile: timing-dependent, can send input to the wrong prompt, and removes the user from the loop for decisions that may need judgment. Agent Farm uses `tmux send-keys` for `/clear` broadcasts, but auto-answering prompts is a different risk level. | Only use `tmux send-keys` for explicit broadcast commands (like `/clear` or shutdown signals). Never auto-answer prompts. Route the user to the pane instead. The user's judgment is the value proposition of visible panes. |
| **Custom keybinding overlay** | NTM maps F6 to a command palette. Claude Dashboard maps custom keys for navigation. Adding custom tmux keybindings conflicts with users' existing tmux configs and creates learning burden. | Use tmux's default keybindings. Document them clearly. Provide `mow-tools tmux` subcommands as an alternative for users who prefer CLI over keybindings. |
| **Auto-dismissing notifications** | Notifications about input-needed should NOT auto-dismiss on a timer. The user may be away or focused on another pane. Claude Dashboard's auto-refresh (2s) means states update naturally, but notifications must persist until the condition is resolved. | Pinned notifications in the orchestrator dashboard (already built in v1.1) persist until the worker signals the input was provided. Only the worker can dismiss its own input_needed state. |

---

## 4. Lifecycle Management

How processes are spawned, monitored, cleaned up, and recovered from crashes.

### Table Stakes

| Feature | Why Expected | Complexity | Depends On | Notes |
|---------|--------------|------------|------------|-------|
| **Spawn workers via `tmux split-window` with `claude` command** | The fundamental operation. The lead creates a new pane and launches `claude` in it with the worker's agent file and initial prompt. Agent Farm spawns agents in tmux panes. NTM spawns via `ntm spawn`. Overmind spawns via Procfile. | LOW | tmux session exists, worktree created | `tmux split-window -t {session} -v 'cd {worktree_path} && claude --agent-file ~/.claude/mowism/agents/mow-phase-worker.md --prompt "{phase_prompt}"'` followed by layout reflow. |
| **Process exit detection** | When a `claude` process exits (normally or crash), the lead must detect it. tmux provides `remain-on-exit` option and `#{pane_dead}` format variable. Agent Farm uses heartbeat monitoring. Overmind detects process death and can restart. | LOW | tmux session monitoring | Set `tmux set-option -t {pane} remain-on-exit on` so dead panes stay visible with their last output. Lead periodically checks `tmux list-panes -F '#{pane_id} #{pane_dead} #{pane_dead_status}'` to detect exited processes. |
| **Graceful shutdown via close-shop** | Already designed in v1.2's `close-shop.md` workflow: check worker status, handle pending merges, capture deferred items, cleanup worktrees. v1.3 adds: close the tmux session after cleanup. | LOW | close-shop workflow (v1.2) | Add `tmux kill-session -t {session}` as the final step of close-shop. Or leave session alive with a summary pane showing merge results (user preference). |
| **Worker crash checkpoint** | When a `claude` process crashes or exits unexpectedly, the worker's state must be recoverable. v1.2 already designed this: workers write CHECKPOINT.md on failure, STATUS.md tracks progress, and resume detection re-reads artifacts. The tmux pane with `remain-on-exit` preserves the last output for debugging. | LOW | Checkpoint system (v1.2), `remain-on-exit` | No new implementation needed. v1.2's artifact-based resume handles this. The crashed pane stays visible for debugging. When the user is ready, they can respawn the worker in the same pane. |
| **Clean worktree removal after merge** | After a phase completes and merges, its worktree and tmux pane should be cleaned up. v1.2 already handles worktree cleanup via WorktreeRemove hook. v1.3 adds pane cleanup. | LOW | Worktree cleanup (v1.2), pane tracking in manifest | After merge: `tmux kill-pane -t {pane_id}`. Remove pane_id from manifest. Reflow layout with `tmux select-layout {layout}`. |
| **Graceful SIGINT handling** | When the user presses Ctrl+C in the orchestrator pane, all workers must be shut down cleanly -- not orphaned. Overmind handles this with signal propagation. Agent Teams docs warn about orphaned tmux sessions. | MEDIUM | Signal handling in orchestrator process | The orchestrator (either the lead's `claude` process or a wrapper script) traps SIGINT/SIGTERM. On signal: send `tmux send-keys -t {pane} C-c` to each worker pane, wait briefly, then `tmux kill-session`. |

### Differentiators

| Feature | Value Proposition | Complexity | Depends On | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|------------|------------|-------|
| **Worker respawn in same pane** | When a worker crashes, the user should be able to respawn it in the same pane position (not create a new pane that disrupts the layout). tmux's `respawn-pane -t {pane_id} -k` does exactly this. No other AI orchestration tool provides positional respawn -- they all create new panes or sessions. Overmind's `restart` is the closest analog but operates on named processes, not pane positions. | LOW | `remain-on-exit` set, manifest tracks pane IDs | `mow-tools.cjs tmux respawn {phase_number}` looks up pane_id in manifest, calls `tmux respawn-pane -t {pane_id} -k 'cd {worktree_path} && claude --agent-file ... --prompt ...'`. The worker resumes from checkpoint using v1.2's artifact-based resume. |
| **Automatic stall detection** | Beyond crash detection (process exit), detect stalled workers: a `claude` process running but producing no output for N minutes. Agent Farm has heartbeat monitoring. Claude Dashboard tracks uptime and status. Mowism can use tmux's `monitor-silence` option to trigger alerts when a pane has no activity for a configurable period. | LOW | `tmux monitor-silence` | `tmux set-option -t {pane} monitor-silence 300` (5 minutes). tmux sends an alert (bell/activity notification) when silence threshold exceeded. Lead checks for stall alerts and shows notification in dashboard. |
| **DAG-aware pane lifecycle** | Workers spawn only when their phase dependencies are satisfied (DAG-aware). As phases complete and merge, their panes are reclaimed. New phases spawn in the freed pane slots. The pane count stays bounded by the maximum concurrent phases in any wave, not the total phase count. No other tool ties pane lifecycle to a dependency graph. | MEDIUM | DAG scheduler (v1.1), wave-based execution (v1.0) | Lead computes current wave from DAG. Spawns panes for all phases in the wave. When a phase completes, merges, and frees its pane. Checks if downstream phases are now unblocked. Spawns new workers in freed pane positions. Layout reflows automatically. |
| **Context window exhaustion handling** | v1.2 shipped a context window monitor hook (25%/15% thresholds). In tmux mode, when a worker hits the threshold, it can checkpoint and the lead can respawn it in the same pane with a fresh context. The resumed worker picks up from the checkpoint via artifact-based resume. No other tool handles context exhaustion as a lifecycle event with automatic recovery. | MEDIUM | Context monitor hook (v1.2), respawn mechanism, checkpoint system | Worker's context hook fires at 25% remaining. Worker writes CHECKPOINT.md, signals `context_exhaustion` via STATUS.md. Lead detects, respawns worker in same pane with `respawn-pane`. New `claude` instance resumes from checkpoint. |

### Anti-Features

| Anti-Feature | Why Avoid | What to Do Instead |
|--------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Automatic worker restart without user awareness** | Agent Farm auto-restarts agents when they complete or hit issues. For Mowism, a crashed worker may have produced partial/incorrect work. Auto-restarting without user review risks compounding errors. | Notify the user that a worker crashed. Show last output in dead pane (`remain-on-exit`). Offer respawn command. Let the user decide: respawn, inspect, or abandon. |
| **Process supervision daemon** | Building a persistent supervisor process (like systemd or supervisord) adds complexity and a new process to manage. The lead orchestrator IS the supervisor. | The lead agent monitors worker panes via `tmux list-panes` and STATUS.md polling. No separate daemon. If the lead dies, the tmux session persists and workers continue (they are independent `claude` processes). User can re-attach and restart the lead. |
| **Cross-session process migration** | Moving a worker from one tmux session to another (e.g., load balancing). tmux supports `move-pane` but the complexity and edge cases (worktree paths, manifest updates, layout disruption) are not worth it. | Workers stay in the session they were spawned in. If a session is overloaded, start a new milestone session. |

---

## 5. Status/Progress Display

How the orchestrator shows aggregate status while workers show per-phase detail.

### Table Stakes

| Feature | Why Expected | Complexity | Depends On | Notes |
|---------|--------------|------------|------------|-------|
| **Orchestrator dashboard with active phases table** | Already built in v1.1: `dashboard render` shows phase number, name, status, plan progress (N/M), percentage bar, and latest activity. This must continue to work in the tmux orchestrator pane. Agent Farm has a controller window with status dashboard. Claude Dashboard has a table display. | LOW | Dashboard (v1.1) | No new implementation. The lead calls `dashboard render` and prints to its pane. May need to adjust width calculation for the orchestrator pane width (narrower than full terminal). |
| **Worker-level detail in worker panes** | Each worker pane shows Claude Code's native output -- the conversation, tool calls, file edits, etc. This is the detail view. The orchestrator shows summary; workers show full execution. Agent Teams split-pane mode works exactly this way. | LOW | tmux (built-in) | No implementation needed. Worker panes run full `claude` CLI sessions. Their output is native Claude Code output. |
| **Event log in orchestrator** | Already built in v1.1: `dashboard event add` logs events (plan_started, plan_complete, phase_complete, error, stage_transition). The event log shows recent activity chronologically. | LOW | Dashboard events (v1.1) | Workers write events to STATUS.md. Lead reads STATUS.md files and adds events to dashboard via `dashboard event add`. The event log already renders in the dashboard. |
| **Phase progress percentage** | Already built: dashboard computes `completed_plans / total_plans` per phase from STATUS.md. Shows as percentage and bar. | LOW | STATUS.md plan progress table | No new implementation. Works via existing STATUS.md -> dashboard render pipeline. |

### Differentiators

| Feature | Value Proposition | Complexity | Depends On | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|------------|------------|-------|
| **Lifecycle stage visibility per worker** | Each worker moves through discuss -> research -> plan -> execute -> refine stages (v1.2 full-lifecycle). The orchestrator dashboard should show which stage each worker is currently in, not just "executing." No other tool shows lifecycle stage -- they show only running/idle/done. Agent Teams shows task progress but not stage within a task. | LOW | Stage transition messages (v1.2), dashboard active phases table | Workers already send `stage_transition` messages when moving between stages. Add a "Stage" column to the dashboard's Active Phases table: `| Phase | Name | Stage | Plans | % | Activity |`. The stage value comes from the latest `stage_transition` event for each phase. |
| **Aggregate milestone progress banner** | Already built in v1.2: auto-advance mode shows `AUTO-ADVANCE Phase N/M Milestone: X% N/M done` banner at the top of the dashboard. In tmux mode, this banner is always visible in the orchestrator pane, giving the user a "glance and know" experience. | LOW | Auto-advance banner (v1.2) | Already implemented. Works in tmux orchestrator pane without changes. |
| **Tmux status bar integration** | tmux's status bar (bottom of screen) can show custom content. Display aggregate progress in the status bar: `MOW: 3/5 phases | Phase 9: executing (plan 2/4) | Phase 10: discussing`. Visible even when zoomed into a worker pane. No other tool puts orchestration status in the tmux status bar. | MEDIUM | tmux status bar API, dashboard state | `tmux set-option -g status-right '#(node ~/.claude/mowism/bin/mow-tools.cjs tmux status-line)'` where `tmux status-line` reads dashboard state JSON and formats a one-line summary. Updates on each tmux status-interval (default 15s). |
| **Pane title as real-time status** | tmux pane titles (visible in certain status bar configs and via `list-panes`) can be updated programmatically. Workers update their pane title as they progress: `Phase 9: executing plan 2/4` -> `Phase 9: refining`. Agent Farm updates pane titles with agent status. | LOW | `tmux select-pane -T` from worker | Workers call `tmux select-pane -T "P{N}: {stage} {detail}"` at each stage transition. The lead can also read pane titles via `tmux list-panes -F '#{pane_title}'` as a lightweight status poll without reading STATUS.md. |

### Anti-Features

| Anti-Feature | Why Avoid | What to Do Instead |
|--------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Token velocity / cost tracking per pane** | NTM shows tokens-per-minute badges. While interesting, implementing token tracking requires parsing Claude Code's output or API usage data, which is not exposed in a standard way. It is a monitoring feature, not an orchestration feature. | Defer to Claude Code's own cost reporting. If users want cost visibility, they can use Claude Code's built-in `/cost` command in any worker pane. |
| **Real-time log streaming from workers to orchestrator** | Piping worker output to the orchestrator pane (like Overmind's interleaved output or concurrently's prefixed output) creates an illegible wall of text from multiple agents. The whole point of separate panes is to avoid interleaving. | Workers write to their own panes. Orchestrator shows summary via dashboard. Events (discrete, structured) flow from workers to lead. Full output stays in worker panes. |
| **Web-based monitoring dashboard** | Tempting to build a web UI showing pane status, progress charts, etc. This was explicitly rejected in v1.0 research as an anti-feature. Mowism's users are CLI-first. | The tmux orchestrator pane IS the dashboard. For remote monitoring, tmux supports SSH attachment. |

### Dependency Summary

**Tmux session management is the foundation.** Everything depends on being able to create, name, and manage tmux panes programmatically. This is LOW complexity since it is just tmux CLI commands.

**Agent Teams removal is the highest-risk change.** It replaces the inter-agent communication backbone (SendMessage/TaskUpdate/TaskList) with a file-based protocol (STATUS.md + dashboard events). The file-based protocol mostly already exists from v1.1/v1.2. The risk is in the agent prompt rewrites -- removing Agent Teams tool references from mow-team-lead.md and mow-phase-worker.md and replacing with tmux + file-based equivalents.

**File-based communication is mostly already built.** STATUS.md single-writer protocol, dashboard events, pinned notifications -- all shipped in v1.1/v1.2. The new work is: lead polls STATUS.md files instead of receiving Agent Teams inbox messages. This is a pull model replacing a push model.

**Layout and status display are low-risk enhancements** that build on existing dashboard rendering and formatting tools.

## MVP Recommendation (v1.3)

### Phase 1: Tmux Session Primitives

Build the `mow-tools.cjs tmux` subcommand group:
- `tmux create-session {name}` -- create a named tmux session with orchestrator pane
- `tmux spawn-worker {phase} {worktree_path}` -- split a new pane and launch `claude`
- `tmux focus {phase}` -- select the pane for a given phase
- `tmux respawn {phase}` -- restart a crashed worker in its original pane
- `tmux list` -- show all panes with phase mappings
- `tmux status-line` -- one-line summary for tmux status bar
- `tmux kill-session` -- clean up

**Rationale:** Infrastructure. All other features depend on tmux primitives. Low complexity -- these are wrappers around tmux CLI commands.

### Phase 2: Agent Teams Removal + File-Based Protocol

- Rewrite mow-team-lead.md: remove SendMessage/TaskUpdate/TaskList/TeamCreate/TeamDelete tools. Replace with tmux pane management + STATUS.md polling.
- Rewrite mow-phase-worker.md: remove SendMessage/TaskUpdate tools. Replace with STATUS.md writes (already designed, mostly already implemented).
- Add STATUS.md polling loop to lead: read all worker STATUS.md files at interval, update dashboard.
- Add capture-pane fallback: detect worker state from pane content when STATUS.md is stale.
- Remove `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` dependency from install script and documentation.

**Rationale:** The biggest change. Must be done as a unit -- cannot have half-Agent-Teams and half-tmux. Requires careful agent prompt rewriting. Most of the file-based protocol already exists.

### Phase 3: Layout, Interaction, and Status Display

- Dynamic layout selection based on worker count
- Phase-colored pane borders
- Input-needed routing with pane border change
- `mow-tools tmux focus {phase}` convenience command
- Tmux status bar integration
- Pane title updates from workers
- Lifecycle stage column in dashboard

**Rationale:** UX polish that makes the tmux experience feel intentional, not accidental. Low-medium complexity. High user-visible impact.

### Phase 4: Lifecycle and Recovery

- `remain-on-exit` for crash visibility
- Worker respawn in same pane via `respawn-pane`
- Stall detection via `monitor-silence`
- DAG-aware pane spawning (spawn on unblock, reclaim on merge)
- Context exhaustion -> respawn flow
- Graceful SIGINT propagation

**Rationale:** Resilience features. Can be added incrementally after core tmux execution works.

## Ecosystem Patterns Summary

### Patterns Adopted from Ecosystem

| Pattern | Source | Why |
|---------|--------|-----|
| **Tmux-backed process isolation** | Overmind, Agent Farm, NTM | Proven pattern. Each process gets a full PTY. Colored output preserved. Interactive debugging possible. |
| **Connect-to-interact** | Overmind (`overmind connect`), Agent Teams (split-pane click) | User clicks/selects a pane to interact with a specific worker. The orchestrator routes, not intermediates. |
| **Dedicated controller/orchestrator pane** | Agent Farm (controller window), k9s-style Dashboard | Separates monitoring from execution. Orchestrator shows aggregate; workers show detail. |
| **Named pane identification** | NTM (named panes), Overmind (named processes), Concurrently (prefixed output) | Users must know which pane is which. Names + colors + borders provide three identification channels. |
| **`remain-on-exit` for crash debugging** | tmux native, Overmind (can-die processes) | Dead panes preserve last output for diagnosis. User decides when to respawn or kill. |
| **File-based state coordination** | Agent Farm (JSON files + file locking), Mowism STATUS.md (v1.1) | More reliable than message passing for multi-process coordination. Files survive process crashes. No custom IPC protocol needed. |

### Patterns Rejected from Ecosystem

| Pattern | Source | Why Rejected |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Custom TUI rendering** | claude-squad, claude-tmux, claude-dashboard, NTM | Engineering effort better spent on orchestration intelligence. tmux + mow-tools formatting is sufficient. |
| **Interleaved output aggregation** | Overmind (default), Concurrently (prefixed) | Illegible with AI agent output. Separate panes are strictly better for readability. |
| **Agent-level auto-restart** | Agent Farm (auto-restart on completion/error) | Dangerous for code-writing agents. A crashed agent may have produced bad code. User must review before respawn. |
| **Token velocity monitoring** | NTM (tokens-per-minute badges) | Not exposed by Claude Code in a standard way. Monitoring feature, not orchestration feature. |
| **Scrollable session list (one-at-a-time viewing)** | claude-squad, claude-tmux | Defeats the purpose of parallel visibility. All panes visible simultaneously. |
