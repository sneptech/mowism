<current_state>
v1.1 milestone scoping via full lifecycle walkthrough audit. Walking through every Mowism command step-by-step to find gaps before defining formal requirements. About halfway through the lifecycle.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Fixed README attribution: TÂCHES/@glittercowboy (not Cole Medin), sneptech (not maxkreischer), correct GSD repo URL
- User updated README formatting (committed)
- Audited install process: works Linux/macOS, no Windows support (flagged for future)
- Walked through `/mow:new-project` end-to-end (all 9 steps including auto mode) — verified correct
- Walked through `/mow:discuss-phase` end-to-end — verified correct
- Audited Agent Teams integration: reviewed team-lead, team-status, worktree-status, execute-phase
- Identified major gap: phases are always sequential (linear chain), no phase-level parallelism
- Identified major gap: no live feedback in orchestrator terminal during multi-agent execution
- Identified major gap: no input routing UX when parallel agents need user attention
- User decided: distributed input model (not centralized/hybrid)
- User decided: color-coded terminal badges (red = orchestrator, bright rotating colors = workers)
- User decided: rich notifications showing phase/mode, input type, which terminal
- Created 4 todos capturing all gaps
- Audited README commands table: only 17/34 commands documented
- Compared with GSD README: missing lifecycle narrative, config docs, security, troubleshooting
- Updated STATE.md with full session context and MEMORY.md for cross-session persistence
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

Continue lifecycle walkthrough from these commands (not yet reviewed):
- `/mow:plan-phase` — research → plan → verify loop
- `/mow:execute-phase` — detailed wave execution mechanics (reviewed at high level for Agent Teams only)
- `/mow:refine-phase` — tiered quality gates (minimum/complex/algorithmic)
- `/mow:verify-work` — conversational UAT
- `/mow:complete-milestone` — archive and prep
- `/mow:pause-work` and `/mow:resume-work` — session continuity
- `/mow:quick` — ad-hoc task mode
- `/mow:debug` — systematic debugging
- Quality skills — scope-check, simplify, dead-code-sweep, prove-it, grill-me, change-summary

After walkthrough completes:
- Formalize v1.1 requirements from all discovered gaps and todos
- Run `/mow:new-milestone` properly to create REQUIREMENTS.md and ROADMAP.md
- Write the README overhaul (confirmed v1.1 scope)
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- README overhaul is confirmed v1.1 scope
- Lifecycle narrative style: GSD-inspired but Mowism-specific (worktrees, quality gates, Agent Teams)
- Include security + troubleshooting sections; skip community ports/star history
- Distributed input routing model chosen over centralized or hybrid
- Color-coded terminal badges: red background for orchestrator, bright ANSI colors for workers
- Rich notifications in orchestrator must show: phase/mode, input type needed, which terminal to switch to
- Agent Teams API research must happen BEFORE building any multi-agent UX features (load-bearing dependency)
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
- Agent Teams API capabilities are unverified — all multi-agent UX designs depend on what the API actually supports
</blockers>

<context>
The user's approach is to walk through the entire Mowism lifecycle as a mental exercise ("mindgame") — not running tools on a real project, but examining each workflow file to see if the steps make sense and finding gaps. This surfaced the major realization that Mowism's core differentiator (parallel multi-agent execution) has thin UX and no phase-level parallelism. The lifecycle walkthrough is both an audit and a scope-discovery process for v1.1.

<next_action>
Start with: `/mow:resume-work` — continue lifecycle walkthrough from `/mow:plan-phase`. Read STATE.md for full context. The walkthrough pattern is: read the command file and workflow file, summarize what happens step-by-step, discuss with user, flag issues as todos.
