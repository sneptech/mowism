# Milestone v1.0 Audit Report

**Project:** Mowism
**Milestone:** v1.0
**Audited:** 2026-02-20
**Status:** TECH DEBT (all requirements met, no critical blockers, accumulated debt)

---

## Executive Summary

All 36 v1 requirements are satisfied across all three verification sources (phase VERIFICATION.md files, SUMMARY.md frontmatter, REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table). All 4 phases passed their individual verifications. Cross-phase integration is sound for all core user flows.

The milestone has accumulated tech debt — primarily the `/mow:update` workflow being incompatible with the `install.sh` installation method, 2 orphaned workflow files, and ROADMAP.md metadata not reflecting Phase 4 completion. None of these are blockers.

**Previous audit (pre-Phase 4) found 3 critical gaps:**
1. Hardcoded `/home/max/.claude/` paths — **RESOLVED** by Phase 4 (04-01-PLAN.md, commit `bc59af2`)
2. Agent Teams env var mismatch (`'1'` vs `'true'`) — **RESOLVED** by Phase 4 (04-02-PLAN.md, commit `49cdac6`)
3. Stale `mowism/bin/` directory — **RESOLVED** by Phase 4 (04-02-PLAN.md, commit `49cdac6`)

## Integration Check Results

### Connected Flows (5/6)

1. **Install** — `install.sh` copies all commands, agents, workflows, templates, references, bin, help to `~/.claude/`. All `@~/.claude/mowism/` paths resolve correctly post-install.
2. **New Project → Plan Phase → Execute Phase** — Full chain: init → STATE.md → worktree claim → wave execution → mow-executor → worktree release.
3. **Execute Phase → Refine Phase** — Tier selection → quality skill Tasks → VERIFICATION-CHAIN output → STATE.md verification results.
4. **Agent Teams** — new-project offers team spawn → mow-team-lead agent → team-update STATE.md → resume-work re-spawn offer.
5. **??? Help System** — All 34 commands detect `???` → help-open → `$EDITOR` fallback → 34 help files present.

### Broken Flow (1/6)

6. **Install → Update** — `install.sh` creates flat-file `~/.claude/mowism/` (no `.git`). `/mow:update` requires `.git` to exist. After standard install, `/mow:update` exits with "INSTALLED but not git" advice. The `reapply-patches` command also has no saved patches to apply.

### Orphaned Workflows (2)

- `mowism/workflows/discovery-phase.md` — Claims "Called from plan-phase.md" but no reference exists in plan-phase.md.
- `mowism/workflows/verify-phase.md` — Claims "Executed by execute-phase.md" but mow-verifier agent is self-contained with inline instructions.

Both have functionality covered by other mechanisms. No user-facing impact.

## Tech Debt by Phase

### Phase 4: Distribution Portability
- ROADMAP.md Phase 4 plan checkboxes not updated (`[ ]` should be `[x]`)
- ROADMAP.md progress table shows `0/3 | Not Started` but Phase 4 is complete

### Cross-Phase
- `/mow:update` workflow incompatible with `install.sh` installation method
- `update.md` contains stale pre-Phase-3 comment about future tooling
- `discovery-phase.md` workflow orphaned (no caller)
- `verify-phase.md` workflow orphaned (functionality in mow-verifier agent)
- `reapply-patches` command references unimplemented patch-save mechanism

### Total: 7 items across 2 categories

## Test Suite

- **mow-tools.cjs:** 103/103 tests passing
- **All phase verifications:** 4/4 PASSED
- **Integration flows:** 5/6 working
