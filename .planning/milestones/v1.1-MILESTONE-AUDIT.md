# v1.1 Milestone Audit: Multi-Agent UX & Documentation

**Audited:** 2026-02-20T11:30:00Z
**Status:** tech_debt — all requirements met, no critical blockers, accumulated debt needs review
**Scores:** Requirements 18/18 | Phases 5/5 | Integration 17/18 wired | E2E Flows 6/6

## Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | Status | Score | Requirements | Key Finding |
|-------|--------|-------|--------------|-------------|
| 7 — State Coherence Foundation | passed | 4/4 | STATE-01 through STATE-04 SATISFIED | Single-writer protocol enforced; 135 tests pass |
| 8 — DAG-Based Phase Scheduling | passed | 12/12 | DAG-01 through DAG-03 SATISFIED | Kahn's algorithm + DAG analyzer agent; 144 tests pass |
| 9 — Multi-Phase Execution Engine | passed | 14/14 | EXEC-01 through EXEC-03 SATISFIED | Worktree lifecycle + team lead + phase worker; 150 tests pass |
| 10 — Live Feedback & Visual Differentiation | passed | 4/4 | FEED-01 through FEED-04 SATISFIED | Schema v2, dashboard, banners, input routing; 173 tests pass |
| 11 — README Overhaul | passed (owner confirmed) | 12/12 | DOC-01 through DOC-04 SATISFIED | 545-line README, 35 commands documented; human items confirmed OK |

## Requirements Cross-Reference (3-Source)

### Source 1: REQUIREMENTS.md Traceability Table

All 18 v1.1 requirements checked `[x]` and marked "Complete" with phase assignments.

### Source 2: Phase VERIFICATION.md

All 18 requirements listed as "SATISFIED" with evidence in their respective phase verification reports.

### Source 3: SUMMARY.md Frontmatter

**Gap:** None of the 16 SUMMARY.md files contain a `requirements_completed` field in their YAML frontmatter. This is a template structural gap — the v1.1 SUMMARY template does not include this field. This does NOT indicate missing requirements coverage.

### Status Determination

| REQ-ID | VERIFICATION.md | SUMMARY Frontmatter | REQUIREMENTS.md | Final Status |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| STATE-01 | SATISFIED (Phase 7) | missing | `[x]` Complete | **satisfied** |
| STATE-02 | SATISFIED (Phase 7) | missing | `[x]` Complete | **satisfied** |
| STATE-03 | SATISFIED (Phase 7) | missing | `[x]` Complete | **satisfied** |
| STATE-04 | SATISFIED (Phase 7) | missing | `[x]` Complete | **satisfied** |
| DAG-01 | SATISFIED (Phase 8) | missing | `[x]` Complete | **satisfied** |
| DAG-02 | SATISFIED (Phase 8) | missing | `[x]` Complete | **satisfied** |
| DAG-03 | SATISFIED (Phase 8) | missing | `[x]` Complete | **satisfied** |
| EXEC-01 | SATISFIED (Phase 9) | missing | `[x]` Complete | **satisfied** |
| EXEC-02 | SATISFIED (Phase 9) | missing | `[x]` Complete | **satisfied** |
| EXEC-03 | SATISFIED (Phase 9) | missing | `[x]` Complete | **satisfied** |
| FEED-01 | SATISFIED (Phase 10) | missing | `[x]` Complete | **satisfied** |
| FEED-02 | SATISFIED (Phase 10) | missing | `[x]` Complete | **satisfied** |
| FEED-03 | SATISFIED (Phase 10) | missing | `[x]` Complete | **satisfied** |
| FEED-04 | SATISFIED (Phase 10) | missing | `[x]` Complete | **satisfied** |
| DOC-01 | SATISFIED (Phase 11) | missing | `[x]` Complete | **satisfied** |
| DOC-02 | SATISFIED (Phase 11) | missing | `[x]` Complete | **satisfied** |
| DOC-03 | SATISFIED (Phase 11) | missing | `[x]` Complete | **satisfied** |
| DOC-04 | SATISFIED (Phase 11) | missing | `[x]` Complete | **satisfied** |

**Note:** Per strict 3-source matrix, all 18 requirements would be "partial" due to missing SUMMARY frontmatter. However, both VERIFICATION.md (with detailed evidence) and REQUIREMENTS.md traceability confirm satisfaction. The SUMMARY gap is a template issue, not a coverage issue. Final status overridden to **satisfied** based on substantive evidence from the two available sources.

### Orphan Detection

No orphaned requirements. All 18 REQ-IDs in REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table appear in their assigned phase's VERIFICATION.md.

## Cross-Phase Integration Report

### Wiring Summary

| Connection | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Phase 7 → 9: STATUS.md auto-init in worktree create | WIRED | `cmdWorktreeCreate` calls `status init` after worktree creation; detection signal for multi-agent mode |
| Phase 7 → 9: Single-writer protocol in multi-phase execution | WIRED | `execute-plan.md` dual-path; `mow-phase-worker.md` constraint prohibits STATE.md writes |
| Phase 7 → 10: Message schema v1→v2 upgrade | WIRED | v2 is superset of v1; `cmdMessageParse` forward-compatible; all 13 types in `ENABLED_EVENTS` |
| Phase 7 → 10: Structured messages → dashboard pipeline | WIRED | Worker `message format` → lead `message parse` → `dashboard event add` → `dashboard render` |
| Phase 8 → 9: DAG output → team lead task dependencies | WIRED | Team lead Step 1 calls `roadmap analyze-dag --raw`; Step 3 maps `depends_on` to `TaskUpdate({ addBlockedBy })` |
| Phase 8 → 9: Roadmapper → DAG analyzer spawn | WIRED | `mow-roadmapper.md` Step 7.5 spawns `mow-dag-analyzer` via Task() |
| Phase 9 → 10: Phase worker milestone messages → dashboard | WIRED | 11 checkpoint types at lifecycle milestones; auto-pin for `input_needed`/`error` |
| Phase 9 → 10: Banner rendering at worker startup | WIRED | `format banner-phase --phase N` using `PHASE_PALETTE`; orchestrator uses `bg 196` (red) |
| Phases 7-10 → 11: README documents all features | WIRED | 35 commands, DAG scheduling, multi-agent, dashboard, banners, input routing all documented |

### Soft Issue: Recipient Name Inconsistency

**Files:** `mowism/workflows/execute-plan.md` uses `recipient: "team-lead"` | `agents/mow-phase-worker.md` uses `recipient: "lead"`

**Impact:** If these strings don't match the Agent Teams registered name for the orchestrator, SendMessage delivery will fail silently. Only manifests at runtime in live Agent Teams sessions.

**Affected requirements:** STATE-03, FEED-01 (message delivery path)

**Recommendation:** Standardize both to the same string after verifying Agent Teams API behavior for the orchestrator's registered member name.

## E2E Flow Verification

| Flow | Steps | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| new-project → roadmapper → DAG analyzer | 3 steps | Complete |
| execute-phase → team lead → phase workers | 4 steps | Complete |
| Worker messages → dashboard → pinned notifications | 3 steps | Complete |
| Input routing → worker notification → user switch → context recap | 4 steps | Complete |
| close-shop → status check → merge → shutdown | 6 steps | Complete |
| Full lifecycle: new-project through close-shop | 6 stages | Complete |

## Tech Debt Summary

### Structural (Template Gap)

- **All phases:** SUMMARY.md frontmatter missing `requirements_completed` field. The SUMMARY template used for v1.1 does not include this field, preventing 3-source cross-reference from completing automatically. Consider adding the field to the summary template for future milestones.

### Runtime (Needs Verification)

- **Phase 9/10:** SendMessage `recipient` field inconsistency between `execute-plan.md` ("team-lead") and `mow-phase-worker.md` ("lead"). Must be standardized before first live multi-agent session.

### Documentation (Minor)

- **REQUIREMENTS.md:** Says "34 commands" but actual count is 35 — stale number in requirements text

### Informational

- **Phase 10:** 5 pre-existing "placeholder" comments in YAML parser code — not Phase 10 artifacts, not stubs
- **Phase 11:** All human verification items confirmed OK by project owner

### Total: 5 items across 4 categories

## Test Suite Progression

| Phase | Tests Before | Tests After | New Tests |
|-------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| Phase 7 | 103 | 135 | +32 |
| Phase 8 | 135 | 144 | +9 |
| Phase 9 | 144 | 150 | +6 |
| Phase 10 | 150 | 173 | +23 |
| Phase 11 | 173 | 173 | +0 (docs only) |

**Final count:** 173 tests, 0 failures.
