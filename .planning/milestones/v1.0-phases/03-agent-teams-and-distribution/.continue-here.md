<current_state>
Executing Phase 3: Agent Teams and Distribution via /mow:execute-phase 3.

Wave 1 COMPLETE (03-01, 03-02). Wave 2 IN PROGRESS (03-03, 03-04, 03-05 agents spawned in parallel, commits landing). Wave 3 NOT STARTED (03-06 validation sweep).

Three background executor agents were still running at pause time. They will likely finish on their own -- check for SUMMARY.md files on resume.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Wave 1: 03-01 (Agent Teams env detection + team-status) - DONE, 3 commits, 100/100 tests pass
- Wave 1: 03-02 (Install script + README + repo source files) - DONE, 4 commits
- Wave 2: 03-03 (Help system + ??? detection) - IN PROGRESS, agent spawned, help-open command committed
- Wave 2: 03-04 (Lead orchestrator + team-status command) - IN PROGRESS, agent spawned, lead agent committed
- Wave 2: 03-05 (Workflow integrations) - IN PROGRESS, agent spawned, new-project workflow committed
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Wave 2: Check if 03-03, 03-04, 03-05 agents completed (look for SUMMARY.md files)
- Wave 2: Spot-check Wave 2 results (verify SUMMARY.md exists, git commits present, no Self-Check: FAILED)
- Wave 3: Spawn 03-06 (end-to-end validation sweep) -- depends on all Wave 2 plans
- Post-waves: Run phase verifier (mow-verifier agent)
- Post-waves: Update ROADMAP.md phase complete, advance STATE.md
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Worktree claim command not available (mow-tools.cjs doesn't have `worktree` subcommand) -- skipped, non-blocking
- Parallelization enabled: Wave 1 agents ran in parallel (2 agents), Wave 2 agents in parallel (3 agents)
- Used gsd-executor subagent type for all plan execution agents
- Spot-checked Wave 1 results: commits verified, SUMMARY.md exists, no Self-Check failures
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None. All agents progressing normally.

<context>
The execute-phase orchestrator is running the standard workflow: init -> discover plans -> group waves -> spawn agents per wave -> spot-check -> next wave. Currently mid-Wave 2 with 3 parallel agents. On resume, check if Wave 2 agents finished (SUMMARY.md files present), spot-check results, then spawn Wave 3 (03-06 validation sweep). After Wave 3, run phase verification and update roadmap.
</context>

<next_action>
1. Check for 03-03-SUMMARY.md, 03-04-SUMMARY.md, 03-05-SUMMARY.md existence
2. If all exist: spot-check (commits present, no Self-Check: FAILED), report Wave 2 complete
3. If any missing: re-run that plan's executor agent
4. Spawn Wave 3: 03-06 (validation sweep)
5. After Wave 3: run phase verifier, update roadmap, offer next steps

Resume with: /mow:execute-phase 3 (it will auto-detect completed SUMMARYs and resume from first incomplete plan)
