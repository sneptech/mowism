<objective>
Write the first half of the comprehensive README: opening hook, installation, requirements, quick start, full lifecycle narrative (greenfield + multi-agent), and brownfield entry point.

Purpose: A new user must be able to understand what Mowism is, install it, and follow the complete workflow from the README alone. The lifecycle narrative is the centerpiece -- it walks through every stage from project initialization through milestone completion, including the v1.1 multi-agent parallel execution path. The brownfield section ensures users with existing codebases can find their entry point immediately.

Output: README.md rewritten from scratch with sections 1 through 6 complete, with placeholder markers for sections that Plan 02 and 03 will fill in.

  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Rewrite README.md from scratch. Replace the entire current content. Structure:

**Title and one-liner:**
```
# Mowism

Coordinated multi-agent workflows for Claude Code — plan, execute, and ship with parallel agents across git worktrees.
```

**What is Mowism (2-3 paragraphs):**
- First paragraph: What it does (meta-prompting framework for Claude Code, plans and executes project work in phases, optionally parallelizes across worktrees with Agent Teams)
- Second paragraph: Key differentiators (worktree-aware state, DAG-based phase scheduling, tiered quality gates, live agent feedback with color-coded terminals)
- Third paragraph: Origin (forked from GSD by TÂCHES, permanently diverged -- adds multi-agent coordination, state coherence, quality gates)
- Do NOT mention "30+ commands" -- use "35+ /mow:* commands and 7 quality skills" or just "all /mow:* commands"
- Do NOT reference `/mow:join-discord` anywhere

**Install section:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sneptech/mowism.git
cd mowism
./bin/install.sh
```
- Note: installer copies commands/agents/workflows/tools to `~/.claude/`, checks dependencies, reports what's missing
- Do NOT include `npx mowism@latest` -- this is an unverified upstream artifact

**Requirements table:**
| Dependency | Required | Purpose | Install |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | Yes | Runtime environment | [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code) |
| Node.js | Yes | Powers mow-tools.cjs | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) |
| WorkTrunk | Yes | Multi-worktree management (`wt` CLI) | See WorkTrunk repo |

Optional: `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` for multi-agent parallel execution.

**Quick Start (greenfield happy path in 5 lines):**
```
/mow:new-project           # Research + requirements + roadmap
/clear
/mow:plan-phase 1          # Create execution plans
/clear
/mow:execute-phase 1       # Execute all plans
```
Brief explanation: "This initializes .planning/, creates phased plans, and executes them. /clear between commands keeps context fresh."

Leave placeholder comments for sections that Plan 02/03 will write:
- `<!-- COMMANDS_REFERENCE: Plan 02 will write this section -->`

  <name>Task 2: Write lifecycle narrative and brownfield entry sections</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Add two major sections to README.md after the Quick Start section and before the Plan 02 placeholder.

**Section: The Mowism Lifecycle**

Write a numbered walkthrough of the full project lifecycle. Structure it as progressive disclosure: single-agent first, then multi-agent.

**Part 1: Single-Agent Workflow (the default)**

Walk through each stage with the exact command and a 1-2 sentence explanation:

1. **Start a project** -- `/mow:new-project`
   - Deep questioning → optional research (4 parallel agents) → requirements with scoping → roadmap with phases
   - Creates `.planning/` with PROJECT.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, ROADMAP.md, STATE.md, config.json

2. **Discuss a phase** (optional) -- `/mow:discuss-phase N`
   - Capture your vision for how a phase should work before planning
   - Creates CONTEXT.md with decisions that constrain the planner

3. **Research a phase** (optional) -- `/mow:research-phase N`
   - Deep domain research for specialized areas (3D, ML, audio, etc.)
   - Creates RESEARCH.md with standard stack, patterns, pitfalls

4. **Plan a phase** -- `/mow:plan-phase N`
   - Breaks phase into 2-3 task plans with dependency waves
   - Creates XX-NN-PLAN.md files with frontmatter, tasks, verification

5. **Execute a phase** -- `/mow:execute-phase N`
   - Executes plans wave by wave (parallel within waves)
   - Creates XX-NN-SUMMARY.md for each plan, updates STATE.md

6. **Refine a phase** -- `/mow:refine-phase N`
   - Tiered quality gates: minimum (scope+summary), complex (+simplify, dead-code-sweep, grill-me), algorithmic (+prove-it)
   - Creates VERIFICATION-CHAIN-P{N}.md with findings

7. **Verify work** -- `/mow:verify-work N`
   - Conversational UAT: presents test cases one at a time
   - Diagnoses failures and creates fix plans

8. **Complete milestone** -- `/mow:complete-milestone`
   - Archives milestone, creates git tag, prepares for next version
   - Follow with `/mow:new-milestone` for the next body of work

Show the flow as a simple ASCII diagram:
```
new-project → [discuss] → [research] → plan-phase → execute-phase → refine-phase → [verify-work] → complete-milestone
                                              ↑                              |
                                              └── repeat for each phase ─────┘
```
(Brackets = optional steps)

**Part 2: Multi-Agent Parallel Execution (v1.1)**

Present as "When you're ready to parallelize" -- progressive disclosure, not the default.

Explain:
1. **Enable Agent Teams:** `export CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`
2. **DAG-based scheduling:** Roadmap phases declare `depends_on` dependencies. Independent phases run simultaneously in separate worktrees.
3. **How it works:** `/mow:execute-phase` detects Agent Teams, spawns a team lead that creates workers for independent phases across worktrees. Each worker runs its phase autonomously.
4. **Live feedback:** Workers send structured progress messages to the orchestrator. A dashboard shows phase-level status, event log, and pinned notifications.
5. **Color-coded terminals:** Orchestrator has a red banner. Each worker gets a unique bright ANSI color. When a worker needs user input, the orchestrator shows which terminal to switch to (phase name, input type, terminal color).
6. **Cleanup:** `/mow:close-shop` gracefully shuts down the multi-agent session and merges worktrees.

**Section: Brownfield Projects (Existing Codebases)**

Dedicated section, NOT buried in the lifecycle. Show the exact flow:

```
/mow:map-codebase           # Analyze existing code (creates .planning/codebase/)
/clear
/mow:new-project            # Initialize planning on top of analysis
# or
/mow:new-milestone          # If .planning/ already exists from previous work
```

Explain:
- `map-codebase` generates 7 analysis documents: STACK.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, STRUCTURE.md, CONVENTIONS.md, TESTING.md, INTEGRATIONS.md, CONCERNS.md
- These documents feed into the planner's context so plans respect existing patterns
- Can run `map-codebase` before or after `new-project`
- For continuing work on an existing project, use `new-milestone` instead of `new-project`
  </action>
  <verify>
- README.md contains "## The Mowism Lifecycle" or equivalent lifecycle heading
- Lifecycle section includes all 8 stages with command names
- Multi-agent section exists with `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` reference
- Brownfield section exists with `/mow:map-codebase` prominently shown
- ASCII flow diagram is present
- Single-agent workflow comes before multi-agent (progressive disclosure)
  </verify>
  <done>README.md contains a complete lifecycle narrative covering single-agent workflow (8 stages with commands), multi-agent parallel execution (enable, DAG scheduling, live feedback, color terminals), and a dedicated brownfield entry section showing the map-codebase to new-project/new-milestone flow</done>
