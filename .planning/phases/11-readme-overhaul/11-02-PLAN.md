<objective>
Write the complete command reference section of the README: all 35 /mow:* commands organized by category in tables, plus all 7 quality skills in a dedicated subsection.

Purpose: DOC-02 requires all commands documented with description, usage, and examples. This is the reference section users will search when they need a specific command. It must be scannable (categorized tables) while providing depth on demand (expandable details or inline usage).

Output: README.md updated with the full command reference section replacing the Plan 01 placeholder.

@mowism/workflows/help.md (existing command reference with descriptions and usage)
@commands/mow/ (all 35 command YAML frontmatter files -- read for accurate descriptions)
@commands/ (7 quality skill files -- read for skill descriptions)

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Read all command sources and build command inventory</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Before writing anything, read the source material to build an accurate inventory:

1. Read all 35 files in `commands/mow/` directory -- extract `name`, `description`, and `argument-hint` from YAML frontmatter
2. Read all 7 files in `commands/` (quality skills) -- extract name and description
3. Read the `mowism/workflows/help.md` for existing categorization and descriptions
4. Cross-reference: verify every command in `commands/mow/` appears in the help workflow, flag any discrepancies
5. Note any commands in help.md that do NOT exist in `commands/mow/` (e.g., `/mow:join-discord` -- must be excluded)

Build a verified inventory of all 42 commands (35 /mow:* + 7 skills) with accurate descriptions before writing the README section.

Then write the Commands Reference section in README.md, replacing the `<!-- COMMANDS_REFERENCE -->` placeholder from Plan 01.

**Structure the commands section as follows:**

## Commands

Brief intro: "Mowism provides 35 `/mow:*` commands and 7 quality skills. Append `???` to any command for detailed help (e.g., `/mow:execute-phase ???`)."

Use categorized tables. Each category gets a `###` header and a table with columns: Command | Description.

**Categories (from research, refined):**

### Getting Started (3 commands)
| `/mow:new-project` | Initialize project through questioning → research → requirements → roadmap |
| `/mow:help` | Show full command reference |
| `/mow:help-open` | Open help file for a specific command in your editor |

### Phase Planning (4 commands)
| `/mow:discuss-phase N` | Capture your vision for a phase before planning |
| `/mow:research-phase N` | Research domain for complex/niche phases |
| `/mow:list-phase-assumptions N` | Preview Claude's planned approach before committing |
| `/mow:plan-phase N` | Create detailed execution plans for a phase |

### Execution (2 commands)
| `/mow:execute-phase N` | Execute plans wave-by-wave (parallel within waves) |
| `/mow:quick` | Execute small tasks with Mowism guarantees, skip optional agents |

### Quality and Verification (3 commands)
| `/mow:refine-phase N` | Run tiered quality gates (minimum/complex/algorithmic) |
| `/mow:verify-work N` | Conversational UAT against phase deliverables |

Note: Wait -- the research says 3 quality commands, but I only see refine-phase and verify-work as /mow:* quality commands. Check if there's a third one. From the inventory: no, it's refine-phase and verify-work. But verify-work could be separate from Quality. Let me use the research categories exactly.

Actually, use the research inventory (Section: Command Inventory) as the authoritative list. Map each command to its category.

### Roadmap Management (3 commands)
| `/mow:add-phase "description"` | Add phase to end of current milestone |
| `/mow:insert-phase N "description"` | Insert urgent work between existing phases |
| `/mow:remove-phase N` | Remove future phase and renumber |

### Milestone Management (4 commands)
| `/mow:new-milestone` | Start new milestone (questioning → requirements → roadmap) |
| `/mow:complete-milestone` | Archive milestone, create git tag |
| `/mow:audit-milestone` | Audit completion against original intent |
| `/mow:plan-milestone-gaps` | Create phases to close gaps from audit |

### Session Management (3 commands)
| `/mow:progress` | Check status and route to next action |
| `/mow:resume-work` | Resume from previous session with context restoration |
| `/mow:pause-work` | Save context handoff for pausing |

### Debugging and Todos (4 commands)
| `/mow:debug "issue"` | Systematic debugging with persistent state |
| `/mow:add-todo` | Capture idea or task as todo |
| `/mow:check-todos` | List and work on pending todos |

Wait, research shows 4 commands in Debugging & Todos but I only count 3 unique ones (debug, add-todo, check-todos). Let me recheck the inventory... Research shows: debug, add-todo, check-todos, and one more. Actually looking again: 22=debug, 23=add-todo, 24=check-todos. That's 3. The research says "4 commands" for "Debugging & Todos" -- this might include verify-work or be miscounted. Use the actual command files as truth. If only 3, document 3.

### Multi-Agent (3 commands)
| `/mow:team-status` | Show agent team and teammate assignments |
| `/mow:worktree-status` | Show detailed worktree assignment status |
| `/mow:close-shop` | Gracefully shut down multi-agent session |

### Configuration (2 commands)
| `/mow:settings` | Configure workflow toggles and model profile |
| `/mow:set-profile PROFILE` | Quick switch model profile (quality/balanced/budget) |

### Utility (5 commands)
| `/mow:health` | Diagnose .planning/ directory health |
| `/mow:cleanup` | Archive phase directories from completed milestones |
| `/mow:update` | Update Mowism to latest version |
| `/mow:migrate` | Migrate existing GSD .planning/ to Mowism format |
| `/mow:reapply-patches` | Reapply local modifications after update |

After the /mow:* tables, add:

### Quality Skills

Brief intro: "Standalone commands (no `/mow:` prefix) for code quality. Run directly in Claude Code."

| Skill | Description |
|---|---|
| `scope-check` | Verify changes stay within original task scope |
| `simplify` | Audit code for unnecessary complexity |
| `dead-code-sweep` | Find unreachable code after refactors |
| `change-summary` | Generate structured post-change report |
| `prove-it` | Demand evidence that changes work correctly |
| `grill-me` | Aggressive code review before shipping |
| `update-claude-md` | Update CLAUDE.md with session learnings |

End the section with a note: "Run `/mow:help` for the full reference, or append `???` to any command for detailed help."

- Count all commands in the README commands section -- must be exactly 35 /mow:* commands
- Count all quality skills -- must be exactly 7
- Verify no `/mow:join-discord` appears
- Verify every command name matches an actual file in `commands/mow/` (use `ls commands/mow/`)
- Verify every skill name matches an actual file in `commands/` (use `ls commands/*.md`)
- All categories have ### headers
- Each command has a description

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add usage examples and inline help reference to command tables</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Enhance the command tables from Task 1 with usage information. For each category, add a brief usage example below the table showing 1-2 representative commands in context. Use collapsible `<details>` sections for categories with complex usage patterns to keep the README scannable.

For each category table, add a small code block below it showing typical usage. For example:

After the "Phase Planning" table:
```
/mow:discuss-phase 3         # Optional: share your vision first
/mow:research-phase 3        # Optional: research for complex domains
/mow:plan-phase 3            # Create execution plans
```

After the "Debugging and Todos" table:
```
/mow:debug "login fails"     # Start investigation
/clear
/mow:debug                   # Resume after context reset
```

Keep examples short (2-4 lines). These are NOT full tutorials -- that's the lifecycle section's job. These are quick reference examples showing typical invocation patterns.

Also ensure the section introduction mentions the `???` inline help system prominently: "Append `???` to any command for detailed help -- e.g., `/mow:execute-phase ???` opens the full reference for that command."
  </action>
  <verify>
- At least 4 command categories have usage examples below their tables
- Examples use real command names with realistic arguments
- `???` help system is mentioned in the commands section intro
- No code blocks contain non-existent commands
  </verify>
  <done>Command reference section has usage examples for key categories and prominently references the `???` inline help system, making it both a scannable reference and a practical guide</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- README.md command reference section is complete with all 42 commands (35 + 7)
- Every command name matches an actual command file in the repository
- No stale references (no join-discord, no npx mowism)
- Categories match the research recommendation with minor adjustments based on actual command count
- Usage examples are accurate and use real commands
</verification>

<success_criteria>
Any user can find any Mowism command by scanning the categorized reference tables. Each command has a description. Key categories have usage examples. The `???` inline help system is prominently referenced for deeper details.
