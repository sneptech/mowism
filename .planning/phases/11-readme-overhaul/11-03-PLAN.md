<objective>
Write the configuration, security, troubleshooting, directory structure, common workflows, and license sections of the README. Then verify the complete README end-to-end.

Purpose: DOC-04 requires configuration options, security guidance, and troubleshooting to be present and actionable. These are the "advanced" sections that experienced users rely on. The security section is particularly important because Mowism installs files into `~/.claude/` and uses experimental env vars.

Output: README.md completed with all sections, no placeholders remaining. README is the final deliverable.

Replace the `<!-- CONFIG_SECURITY_TROUBLESHOOTING -->` placeholder with the following sections.

**## Configuration**

Brief intro: "Mowism stores settings in `.planning/config.json`. Use `/mow:settings` to configure interactively, or edit the file directly."

**### Settings Overview**

Show a complete config.json example with all options at their defaults:
```json
{
  "model_profile": "balanced",
  "workflow": {
    "research": true,
    "plan_check": true,
    "verifier": true,
    "auto_advance": false
  },
  "git": {
    "branching_strategy": "none"
  },
  "planning": {
    "commit_docs": true,
    "search_gitignored": false
  }
}
```

**### Configuration Reference**

Table with columns: Option | Default | Description | When to Change

| `model_profile` | `"balanced"` | Which Claude model each agent uses | `"budget"` to conserve quota, `"quality"` for critical architecture |
| `workflow.research` | `true` | Spawn researcher during plan-phase | Disable for well-understood domains |
| `workflow.plan_check` | `true` | Spawn plan checker during plan-phase | Disable for faster iteration |
| `workflow.verifier` | `true` | Spawn verifier during execute-phase | Disable for non-critical phases |
| `workflow.auto_advance` | `false` | Auto-chain stages without pausing | Enable for hands-off execution |
| `git.branching_strategy` | `"none"` | Branch strategy: `none`, `phase`, or `milestone` | `"phase"` for code review per phase |
| `planning.commit_docs` | `true` | Commit .planning/ artifacts to git | `false` for OSS contributions or client projects |
| `planning.search_gitignored` | `false` | Include .planning/ in broad searches | `true` when .planning/ is gitignored |
| `model_overrides` | `{}` | Per-agent model overrides | Override specific agents without changing profile |

**### Model Profiles**

Brief explanation: three profiles control which Claude model each agent uses.

| Agent | quality | balanced | budget |
|---|---|---|---|
| Planner | opus | opus | sonnet |
| Roadmapper | opus | sonnet | sonnet |
| Executor | opus | sonnet | sonnet |
| Phase Researcher | opus | sonnet | haiku |
| Project Researcher | opus | sonnet | haiku |
| Research Synthesizer | sonnet | sonnet | haiku |
| Debugger | opus | sonnet | sonnet |
| Codebase Mapper | sonnet | haiku | haiku |
| Verifier | sonnet | sonnet | haiku |
| Plan Checker | sonnet | sonnet | haiku |
| Integration Checker | sonnet | sonnet | haiku |

Note: `balanced` is the default. Use `/mow:set-profile quality` for architecture phases, `/mow:set-profile budget` for routine work.

**### Git Branching Strategies**

- `none` (default): All work on current branch
- `phase`: Creates `mow/phase-{N}-{slug}` branch per phase
- `milestone`: Creates `mow/{milestone}-{slug}` branch per milestone

**## Security**

**### What Mowism Installs**

Mowism installs files into `~/.claude/`:
- `~/.claude/commands/mow/` -- 35 slash commands
- `~/.claude/commands/` -- 7 quality skill commands
- `~/.claude/agents/` -- 11 agent definitions (mow-*.md)
- `~/.claude/mowism/` -- workflows, references, templates, tools
- `~/.claude/settings.local.json` -- Claude Code permission grants (Mowism asks to read/write project files, run Node.js)

All files are plain Markdown and JavaScript. No compiled binaries. No network calls except Claude Code's own API.

**### Environment Variables**

| Variable | Required | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` | No | unset | Set to `1` to enable multi-agent parallel execution |
| `VISUAL` / `EDITOR` | No | system default | Used by `???` help system to open help files |

No API keys are stored or managed by Mowism. Claude Code handles its own authentication.

**### Permissions Model**

Mowism operates within Claude Code's permission system. The `.claude/settings.local.json` file grants:
- File read/write access to project directories
- Bash execution for Node.js (mow-tools.cjs) and git operations
- No network access beyond Claude Code's own API

Review permissions with: `cat .claude/settings.local.json`

**### Private Planning Mode**

To keep planning artifacts out of git:
1. Set `planning.commit_docs: false` in `.planning/config.json`
2. Add `.planning/` to `.gitignore`
3. Optionally set `planning.search_gitignored: true` if you want project-wide searches to include planning files

**## Troubleshooting**

**### Install Issues**

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `install.sh: command not found` | Wrong directory | `cd mowism && ./bin/install.sh` |
| "Node.js not found" warning | Node.js not installed | Install from nodejs.org |
| "WorkTrunk not found" warning | WorkTrunk (`wt` CLI) not installed | See WorkTrunk install docs |

Note: The installer never blocks on missing dependencies -- it reports what's missing and continues.

**### Common Runtime Issues**

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `/mow:execute-phase` says "no plans found" | Phase not planned yet | Run `/mow:plan-phase N` first |
| STATE.md out of sync after git operations | Manual git changes bypassed state tracking | Run `/mow:health` to diagnose, `/mow:health --fix` to repair |
| Context window exhaustion mid-phase | Plan is too large for single context | Use `/clear` between commands; plans are designed for this |
| "Agent Teams not available" | Env var not set | `export CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` |

**### Multi-Agent Issues**

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Workers not spawning | Agent Teams env var missing | Set `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` |
| Worktree conflicts | Stale worktree entries | `/mow:worktree-status` to check, manual cleanup if needed |
| Permission prompts in worker terminal | Worker needs user approval | Check orchestrator dashboard for which terminal needs attention |
| Workers stuck | Context exhaustion or error | `/mow:close-shop` to gracefully shut down, restart |

Then add:

**## `.planning/` Directory Structure**

Show the directory tree (keep the one from the current README but update it to reflect v1.1 additions like `STATUS.md` per phase, `MILESTONES.md`):

```
.planning/
├── PROJECT.md              # Project vision and requirements
├── REQUIREMENTS.md         # Scoped requirements with REQ-IDs

        └── VERIFICATION-CHAIN-PNN.md  # Quality gate results
```

**## Common Workflows**

Keep and update the common workflows section from the current README. Add multi-agent workflow:

**Parallel multi-agent execution:**
```
export CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1
/mow:execute-phase 3        # DAG scheduler runs independent phases in parallel
# Workers appear in separate terminals with color-coded banners
# Orchestrator terminal shows live dashboard
/mow:close-shop             # Graceful shutdown when done
```

Keep existing workflows: starting a project, resuming work, urgent mid-milestone work, completing a milestone, capturing ideas, debugging.

**## License and Attribution**

Keep the existing license section crediting GSD/TÂCHES but update to be more complete:
"Mowism is a permanent fork of [GSD (Get Shit Done)](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done) by [TÂCHES](https://github.com/glittercowboy). Quality skills derived from practices by Andrej Karpathy and Boris Cherny."

1. Open README.md and scan the table of contents (GitHub auto-generates from headers)
2. Verify lifecycle narrative: read the "Mowism Lifecycle" section -- does it cover new-project through complete-milestone?
3. Verify commands: spot-check 5 commands from different categories -- are they all present with descriptions?
4. Verify brownfield: find the brownfield section -- is it easy to locate? Does it show map-codebase flow?
5. Verify configuration: check the config reference table -- are all 9 options there with defaults?
6. Verify security: is there a security section? Does it explain what gets installed where?
7. Verify troubleshooting: are there actual problem/solution entries?
8. Check for stale content: search for "join-discord", "npx mowism", "30+ commands", "34 commands" -- none should appear
9. Read the opening 3 paragraphs -- do they accurately describe what Mowism is?
