<objective>
Extend mow-tools.cjs with WorkTrunk dependency checking, worktree state tracking (claim/release/conflict detection), stale entry cleanup, and verification results tracking in STATE.md.

Purpose: All subsequent Phase 2 plans depend on these mow-tools.cjs primitives. The worktree tracking functions are used by execute-phase (Plan 02-03), and the verification results section is written by refine-phase (Plan 02-04).

Output: Extended mow-tools.cjs with new subcommands and tests.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add WorkTrunk dependency check and wire into all init functions</name>
  <files>bin/mow-tools.cjs</files>
  <action>
Add a `checkWorkTrunk()` function near the top of mow-tools.cjs (in the Helpers section) that:
1. Runs `execSync('command wt --version 2>&1', { encoding: 'utf-8', timeout: 5000 })` to check if `wt` is in PATH
2. Returns `{ installed: true }` on success, `{ installed: false }` on catch
3. Does NOT use `which` or `type` -- use `command` for POSIX portability

Add a `requireWorkTrunk()` function that calls `checkWorkTrunk()` and if `installed` is false, calls `error()` with this exact message:
```
WorkTrunk (wt) is required but not found.

Mowism uses WorkTrunk for git worktree management in multi-agent workflows.

Install via:
  Arch/CachyOS: yay -S worktrunk
  macOS:        brew install max-sixty/tap/worktrunk
  Cargo:        cargo install worktrunk
  Other:        https://worktrunk.dev

After installing, run: wt config shell install
```

Wire `requireWorkTrunk()` as the FIRST call inside every `cmdInit*` function (there are ~12 of them: cmdInitExecutePhase, cmdInitPlanPhase, cmdInitNewProject, cmdInitNewMilestone, cmdInitQuick, cmdInitResume, cmdInitVerifyWork, cmdInitPhaseOp, cmdInitTodos, cmdInitMilestoneOp, cmdInitMapCodebase, cmdInitProgress). Pattern: find each `function cmdInit` and add `requireWorkTrunk();` as the first statement inside the function body.

Per locked decision: check on EVERY `/mow:*` command init, not just worktree-specific commands.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `node bin/mow-tools.cjs init progress 2>&1` -- should succeed (wt is installed).
Run `grep -c "requireWorkTrunk" bin/mow-tools.cjs` -- should show 12+ matches (one per cmdInit function plus the function definition).
  </verify>
  <done>Every cmdInit* function calls requireWorkTrunk() as its first action. checkWorkTrunk() correctly detects wt presence. Error message includes all 4 platform install commands.</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add worktree state tracking, conflict detection, stale cleanup, and verification results to mow-tools.cjs</name>
  <files>bin/mow-tools.cjs, bin/mow-tools.test.cjs</files>
  <action>
Add the following new subcommands to mow-tools.cjs:

**1. `worktree claim <phase>`** — Claims a phase for the current worktree.
- Reads STATE.md, parses "Worktree Assignments" section (or creates it if missing)
- Checks if the phase is already claimed by another worktree (conflict detection per WKTR-03)
  - If claimed: call `error()` with message: "Phase {phase} is being executed by {worktree_path} (started {timestamp}). Cannot claim the same phase from another worktree.\n\nRun `/mow:progress` to see all worktree assignments, or execute a different phase."
  - Hard block, no warning+confirm (per research discretion recommendation)
- Gets current worktree path from `process.cwd()` resolved against git
- Gets current branch from `git branch --show-current`
- Writes a new row to the "Worktree Assignments" table: `| {worktree_path} | {branch} | {phase} | executing | {ISO timestamp} | {session_id from env or 'unknown'} |`
- Session ID: use `process.env.CLAUDE_SESSION_ID || process.env.HOSTNAME || 'unknown'`
- Commits STATE.md if `commit_docs` is true

**2. `worktree release <phase>`** — Releases a worktree's claim on a phase.
- Removes the row matching the current worktree path and the specified phase from "Worktree Assignments"
- Auto-release per locked decision: called when phase execution completes successfully

**3. `worktree status`** — Shows current worktree assignments.
- Reads STATE.md "Worktree Assignments" section
- Returns JSON array of `{ worktree, branch, phase, status, started, agent }`

**4. `worktree clean`** — Stale entry detection and cleanup.
- Runs `wt list --format=json` to get active worktrees
- Cross-references against STATE.md "Worktree Assignments"
- Any entry whose worktree path is NOT in `wt list` output → auto-release
- Logs: "MOW: Released stale claim for {path} (worktree no longer exists)"
- Per research discretion: check-on-init approach

**5. Add stale cleanup call** — Wire `worktree clean` logic into every `cmdInit*` function, right after `requireWorkTrunk()`. Make it silent (no output) unless it actually cleans something. Wrap in try/catch so a `wt list` failure doesn't block init.

**6. `worktree verify-result <phase> --tier <tier> --result <pass|fail|error> [--blockers "..."]`** — Records verification chain results.
- Adds/updates a row in STATE.md's "Verification Results" section: `| {phase} | {tier} | {result} | {date} | {blockers or 'none'} |`
- Creates the section if it doesn't exist, using the format from 02-RESEARCH.md

**7. STATE.md section format** — When creating new sections, use these headers:
```markdown
## Worktree Assignments

| Worktree | Branch | Phase | Status | Started | Agent |
|----------|--------|-------|--------|---------|-------|

### Verification Results

| Phase | Tier | Result | Date | Blockers |
|-------|------|--------|------|----------|
```

**8. Add tests** to bin/mow-tools.test.cjs:
- Test checkWorkTrunk() returns { installed: true } (wt is installed on this system)
- Test worktree claim writes to STATE.md correctly (use a temp directory with mock STATE.md)
- Test worktree claim detects conflict (pre-populate STATE.md with an existing claim)
- Test worktree release removes the correct row
- Test worktree clean removes entries for non-existent paths
- Test worktree verify-result writes verification results section

Register all new subcommands in the main command dispatch (the large if/else chain at the bottom of mow-tools.cjs).
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `node bin/mow-tools.cjs worktree status 2>&1` from the repo root -- should return empty JSON array or section not found.
Run `node bin/mow-tools.test.cjs 2>&1 | tail -5` -- all tests pass including new worktree tests.
  </verify>
  <done>
All 6 worktree subcommands exist and are registered. Conflict detection hard-blocks with clear message. Stale cleanup runs silently on every init. Verification results section can be written. Tests pass.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- `node bin/mow-tools.cjs init progress` succeeds (wt check passes)
- `grep -c "requireWorkTrunk" bin/mow-tools.cjs` returns 12+
- `node bin/mow-tools.cjs worktree status` returns valid JSON
- `node bin/mow-tools.test.cjs` passes all tests including new ones
- STATE.md can have worktree assignments and verification results written/read
</verification>

<success_criteria>
mow-tools.cjs has all worktree primitives that Plans 02-03 and 02-04 depend on. WorkTrunk is a hard gate on every init. Conflict detection is a hard block. Stale cleanup is automatic. All new code has tests.
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/02-worktree-state-and-quality-gates/02-01-SUMMARY.md`
