<current_state>
Phase 12 (Audit Gap Closure) fully executed and verified. This was the last phase of v1.1. All 17/17 plans across 6 phases (7-12) are complete. The milestone is ready for archival via `/mow:complete-milestone`.

Modified README.md is sitting unstaged — this is from a prior session, not from phase 12 work.

<remaining_work>

- v1.1 milestone completion: run `/mow:complete-milestone` to archive milestone
- 1 pending todo: full-lifecycle multi-agent workers (flagged for future, not v1.1)
- Unstaged README.md change needs review/decision
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- No new architectural decisions — phase 12 was surgical fixes only
- Historical documents (audit files, v1.0 artifacts) intentionally left unchanged

<context>
v1.1 is fully built and verified. The natural next step is `/mow:complete-milestone` which will archive the milestone, update PROJECT.md, and prepare for v1.2 scoping. The unstaged README.md modification predates this session and should be reviewed before or during milestone completion.
</context>

<next_action>
Start with: `/mow:complete-milestone` to archive v1.1 and close out the milestone. Review the unstaged README.md change first — decide whether to commit, discard, or fold into milestone completion.
