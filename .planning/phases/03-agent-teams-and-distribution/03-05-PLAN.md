<objective>
Integrate Agent Teams offers and nudges into the new-project, resume-work, and execute-phase workflows.

Purpose: Users need to be offered Agent Teams at key moments (TEAM-01: new-project, TEAM-02: resume-work) and nudged when they don't have it enabled (per locked decisions). These are the user-facing touchpoints that connect the Agent Teams infrastructure (Plans 03-01, 03-04) to the actual user experience.

Output: Modified workflow files with Agent Teams integration.

  <name>Task 1: Add Agent Teams offer and nudge to new-project workflow</name>
  <files>~/.claude/mowism/workflows/new-project.md</files>
  <action>
  Modify `~/.claude/mowism/workflows/new-project.md` to add Agent Teams integration. Add a new step after the project setup is complete (after roadmap approval, before final output):

  **Agent Teams offer/nudge step:**

  Read the `agent_teams_enabled` and `agent_teams_nudge_dismissed` values from the init JSON (already loaded in Step 1).

  **Case 1: Agent Teams IS enabled (`agent_teams_enabled: true`):**
  - After roadmap is approved and has phases with 3+ plans, offer:
    "Agent Teams is enabled. Would you like to set up parallel execution with a lead orchestrator and workers across worktrees? (yes/no)"
  - If yes: spawn the lead orchestrator using the mow-team-lead agent definition. The lead will handle team creation, task assignment, and worker spawning.
  - If no: continue with standard sequential execution.

  **Case 2: Agent Teams is NOT enabled (`agent_teams_enabled: false`):**
  - **If this is a new project (always nudge per locked decision, regardless of dismiss state):**
    Show prominent nudge block:
    ```

    ## Agent Teams: Parallel Execution

    Mowism works great solo, but its most powerful feature is running
    multiple Claude Code sessions in parallel across git worktrees.

    **To enable Agent Teams:**

    Option A (shell):
      export CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1

    Option B (settings.json):
      Add to ~/.claude/settings.json:
      { "env": { "CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS": "1" } }

    Then restart Claude Code.

    With Agent Teams, /mow:execute-phase spawns workers that each
    handle a plan in their own worktree -- simultaneously.

    > Type "don't remind me" to dismiss for this project.
    ---
    ```
  - If user says "don't remind me": run `node ~/.claude/mowism/bin/mow-tools.cjs config nudge-dismiss`

  **Per locked decisions:**
  - Prominent nudge at /mow:new-project (key moment)
  - Always nudge once at start of new project regardless of dismiss state
  - Persistent per-project dismiss saved to project config
  </action>
  <verify>Read the modified workflow and confirm it checks agent_teams_enabled, shows prominent nudge when not enabled, offers team setup when enabled, and handles dismiss.</verify>
  <done>new-project workflow shows Agent Teams offer when enabled, prominent nudge when not enabled (always for new projects), and supports "don't remind me" dismiss.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add team re-spawn offer to resume-work and nudge to execute-phase</name>
  <files>~/.claude/mowism/workflows/resume-project.md, ~/.claude/mowism/workflows/execute-phase.md</files>
  <action>
  **resume-project.md modifications:**

  Add a step after loading state (after Step load_state):

  1. Check `agent_teams_enabled` from init JSON
  2. Read STATE.md Agent Team Status section (via `node ~/.claude/mowism/bin/mow-tools.cjs team-status --raw`)
  3. **If Agent Teams is enabled AND previous team activity exists in STATE.md:**
     - Show: "A previous agent team was active for this project. Would you like to re-spawn the team to continue parallel execution? (yes/no)"
     - If yes: read incomplete plans from STATE.md/ROADMAP.md, spawn fresh lead orchestrator (Agent Teams has NO session resumption per research -- must create fresh team)
     - If no: continue with standard resume flow
  4. **If Agent Teams is NOT enabled AND NOT dismissed:** Show lighter tooltip:
     "Tip: Agent Teams can execute this phase's plans in parallel. Enable: export CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1"

  Per discretion: offer team re-spawn during resume-work (recommended by research since it's the ONLY option for continuing team work after session end).

  **execute-phase.md modifications:**

  Add nudge logic after the initialize step (after worktree claim):

  1. Check `agent_teams_enabled` and `agent_teams_nudge_dismissed` from init JSON
  2. **If Agent Teams IS enabled:** No nudge needed. (The lead orchestrator handles team setup separately when invoked.)
  3. **If Agent Teams is NOT enabled:**
     - **If not dismissed:** Show prominent nudge (same format as new-project but contextual):
       ```
       This phase has {N} plans across {M} waves. With Agent Teams,
       these plans could execute in parallel across worktrees.
       ```
       Include enable instructions. Support "don't remind me" dismiss.
     - **If dismissed:** Show lighter tooltip only:
       "Tip: Agent Teams can execute this phase's {N} plans in parallel. Enable: export CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1"

  Per locked decisions:
  - Prominent nudge at /mow:execute-phase (key moment)
  - Lighter tooltips between phases highlighting productivity gains
  - Persistent per-project dismiss
  </action>
  <verify>Read both modified workflows and confirm: resume-project checks for previous team activity and offers re-spawn; execute-phase shows prominent nudge when not dismissed and lighter tooltip when dismissed.</verify>
  <done>resume-project workflow offers team re-spawn from STATE.md when Agent Teams is enabled. execute-phase workflow shows prominent nudge (not dismissed) or lighter tooltip (dismissed) when Agent Teams is not enabled.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- new-project.md contains agent_teams_enabled check and prominent nudge block
- new-project.md offers team setup when Agent Teams is enabled
- resume-project.md checks for previous team activity and offers re-spawn
- execute-phase.md shows nudge or tooltip based on dismiss state
- All three workflows reference mow-tools.cjs for config/state operations
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- TEAM-01: /mow:new-project offers Agent Teams setup with lead orchestrator
- TEAM-02: /mow:resume-work offers team re-spawn from STATE.md
- Nudge appears prominently at new-project and execute-phase, with lighter tooltips elsewhere
- Dismiss persists via mow-tools.cjs config nudge-dismiss
- New projects always get one nudge regardless of dismiss state
